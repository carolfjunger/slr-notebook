Despite its great potential in healthcare, it is not widely adopted because it requires interactions on both the image (vision) and question (language) to generate an answer. Existing methods focused on treating vision and language features independently, which were unable to capture the high and low-level interactions that are required for VQA. Further, these methods failed to offer capabilities to interpret the retrieved answers, which are obscure to humans where the models' interpretability to justify the retrieved answers has remained largely unexplored. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce a vision-language transformer that embeds vision (images) and language (questions) features for an interpretable PathVQA. We present an interpretable transformer-based Path-VQA (TraP-VQA), where we embed transformers' encoder layers with vision and language features extracted using pre-trained CNN and domain-specific language model (LM), respectively. A decoder layer is then embedded to upsample the encoded features for the final prediction for PathVQA. Our experiments showed that our TraP-VQA outperformed the state-of-the-art comparative methods with public PathVQA dataset. Our experiments validated the robustness of our model on another medical VQA dataset, and the ablation study demonstrated the capability of our integrated transformer-based vision-language model for PathVQA. Finally, we present the visualization results of both text and images, which explain the reason for a retrieved answer in PathVQA.  © 2013 IEEE.","interpretability; Pathology images; vision-language; visual question answering","Electric Power Supplies; Humans; Language; Decoding; Flow visualization; Graphical user interfaces; Problem oriented languages; Visual languages; Decoding; Features extraction; Interpretability; Pathology image; Predictive models; Question Answering; Task analysis; Transformer; Vision-language; Visual question answering; article; feature extraction; human; human experiment; language; prediction; predictive model; trust; vision; power supply; Pathology","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21682194","","ITIBF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127535492"

However, to achieve the primary benefits of automating this part of decision-making, people must be able to trust the machine learning model’s outputs. In order to enhance people’s trust and promote appropriate reliance on the model, visualization techniques such as interactive model steering, performance analysis, model comparison, and uncertainty visualization have been proposed. In this study, we tested the effects of two uncertainty visualization techniques in a college admissions forecasting task, under two task difficulty levels, using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Results show that (1) people’s reliance on the model depends on the task difficulty and level of machine uncertainty and (2) ordinal forms of expressing model uncertainty are more likely to calibrate model usage behavior. These outcomes emphasize that reliance on decision support tools can depend on the cognitive accessibility of the visualization technique and perceptions of model performance and task difficulty. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

To overcome this, various post-hoc attribution methods have been proposed to identify image regions most influential to the models' decisions. Evaluating such methods is challenging since no ground truth attributions exist. We thus propose three novel evaluation schemes to more reliably measure the faithfulness of those methods, to make comparisons between them more fair, and to make visual inspection more systematic. To address faithfulness, we propose a novel evaluation setting (DiFull) in which we carefully control which parts of the input can influence the output in order to distinguish possible from impossible attributions. To address fairness, we note that different methods are applied at different layers, which skews any comparison, and so evaluate all methods on the same layers (ML-Att) and discuss how this impacts their performance on quantitative metrics. For more systematic visualizations, we propose a scheme (AggAtt) to qualitatively evaluate the methods on complete datasets. We use these evaluation schemes to study strengths and shortcomings of some widely used attribution methods over a wide range of models. Finally, we propose a post-processing smoothing step that significantly improves the performance of some attribution methods, and discuss its applicability.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Attribution evaluation; attribution methods; explainability; model faithfulness","Deep neural networks; Visualization; Attribution evaluation; Attribution method; Evaluation scheme; Explainability; Head; Informatics; Location awareness; Model faithfulness; Performance; Systematic; article; benchmarking; controlled study; deep neural network; fairness; vision; Computer vision","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","01628828","","ITPID","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182949154"

Traditional prediction models often rely on historical data and mathematical algorithms, which may lack the ability to adapt to dynamic real-world conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates sensor data with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) principles to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of vehicle count predictions. The proposed system utilizes a network of sensors deployed across key traffic points to collect real-time data on vehicle movements, including speed, volume, and direction. This sensor data is then fed into a machine learning model, specifically designed to predict vehicle counts based on various environmental and contextual factors. Unlike conventional black-box models, the proposed system leverages XAI techniques to provide transparent insights into the decision-making process, enabling stakeholders to understand and trust the predictions. Key components of the XAI-based prediction model include feature importance analysis, model-agnostic interpretability methods, and interactive visualization tools. By identifying the most influential features and explaining the rationale behind predictions, the system empowers transportation planners and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding traffic management strategies and infrastructure investments. By enhancing both accuracy and interpretability, the proposed system paves the way for more effective traffic management strategies and ultimately improves the overall quality of urban mobility.  © 2024 IEEE.","accuracy; Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); interpretability; Sensor data integration; traffic flow optimization; transparency; urban mobility","Data integration; Decision making; Deep learning; Intelligent systems; Investments; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Visualization; Accuracy; Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); Flow optimization; Interpretability; Prediction modelling; Sensor data integration; Traffic flow; Traffic flow optimization; Urban mobility; Vehicle counts; Forecasting","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE","9th International Conference on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, ICONSTEM 2024","4 April 2024 through 5 April 2024","Chennai","200626","","979-835036509-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198843036"

Justification and transparency represent two crucial goals in explainable recommendations. Different from transparency, which faithfully exposes the reasoning behind the recommendation mechanism, justification conveys a conceptual model that may differ from that of the underlying algorithm. An explanation is an answer to a question. In explainable recommendation, a user would want to ask questions (referred to as intelligibility types) to understand the results given by an RS. In this paper, we identify relationships between Why and How explanation intelligibility types and the explanation goals of justification and transparency. We followed the Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach and leveraged the What–Why–How visualization framework to systematically design and implement Why and How visual explanations in the transparent Recommendation and Interest Modeling Application (RIMA). Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative user study (N = 12) based on a thematic analysis of think-aloud sessions and semi-structured interviews with students and researchers to investigate the potential effects of providing Why and How explanations together in an explainable RS on users’ perceptions regarding transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Our study shows qualitative evidence confirming that the choice of the explanation intelligibility types depends on the explanation goal and user type. © 2023 by the authors.","explainable recommendation; justification; recommender systems; transparency; trust; visualization","Transparency; Visualization; Conceptual model; Design approaches; Explainable recommendation; Human-centred designs; Informed decision; Justification; Recommendation mechanism; Scientific literature; Trust; Visualization framework; Recommender systems","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20782489","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166385807"

Design professionals play a crucial role in this research context as they not only take part in the development of technology applications but are also involved in shaping public narratives about socio-technical relations as agents of public imagination. We examined how designers envision future societies and how future narratives as a result of design processes are reflected upon by an external audience. In Study 1, we rolled out three speculative design workshops in Japan and Germany with young design professionals. The analysis of the resulting design representations (artifacts) reveals that the relationship between human autonomy and AI-driven automation represents a central theme in the imagination of futures. Visions created in Japan draw from (pop-)culture-specific narratives, but also from governmental agendas. In projects from Germany, corporations lead the deployment of AI systems that alter society and social interactions. In a follow-up Study 2, we analyze the perceptions of created artifacts through a survey with 174 students from computer science. We identify loss of privacy, ethical concerns, governmental control, surveillance, and loss of free speech as main themes of reflection, which is in line with themes raised by designers. Students focus on societal impacts of use and aims of depicted applications rather than on AI as technical facet. Visualizations created in Study 1 appear to have a strong influence on the audience's impression of the depicted technological applications in Study 2. Although cultural differences regarding style of visualization seem to play a decisive role for creation in Study 1, they do not seem to have a major effect on participants' reflections in Study 2. Overall, findings from both studies contribute to advancing the understanding of design speculations in creation and perception.  © 2023 Owner/Author.","AI; cross-cultural; public perception; research through design; speculative design","Design; Ethical technology; AI Technologies; Cross-cultural; Design professionals; Design workshops; Design-process; Public perception; Research through design; Sociotechnical; Speculative design; Technology application; Visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGCAS; Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)","3rd ACM Conference on Information Technology for Social Good, GoodIT 2023","6 September 2023 through 8 September 2023","Lisbon","192487","","979-840070116-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174290939"

Instead, tackling fairness must be inclusive and involve domain experts with specialized tools and workflows. Thus, domain-specific visualizations are needed for algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, while much work on AI fairness has focused on predictive decisions, less has been done for fair allocation and planning, which require human expertise and iterative design to integrate myriad constraints. We propose the Intelligible Fair Allocation (IF-Alloc) Framework that leverages explanations of causal attribution (Why), contrastive (Why Not) and counterfactual reasoning (What If, How To) to aid domain experts to assess and alleviate unfairness in allocation problems. We apply the framework to fair urban planning for designing cities that provide equal access to amenities and benefits for diverse resident types. Specifically, we propose an interactive visual tool, Intelligible Fair City Planner (IF-City), to help urban planners to perceive inequality across groups, identify and attribute sources of inequality, and mitigate inequality with automatic allocation simulations and constraint-satisfying recommendations (IF-Plan). We demonstrate and evaluate the usage and usefulness of IF-City on a real neighborhood in New York City, US, with practicing urban planners from multiple countries, and discuss generalizing our findings, application, and framework to other use cases and applications of fair allocation. © 2023 IEEE.

Counterfactual (CF) explanations have recently gained prominence for their ability to interpret black-box Deep Learning (DL) models. CF examples are associated with minimal changes in the input, resulting in a complementary output by the DL model. Finding such alternations, particularly for high-dimensional visual inputs, poses significant challenges. Besides, the temporal dependency introduced by the reliance of the DRL agent action on a history of past state observations further complicates the generation of CF examples. To address these challenges, we propose using a saliency map to identify the most influential input pixels across the sequence of past observed states by the agent. Then, we feed this map to a deep generative model, enabling the generation of plausible CFs with constrained modifications centred on the salient regions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in diverse domains, including ADS, Atari Pong, Pacman and Space-invaders games, using traditional performance metrics such as validity, proximity and sparsity. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework generates more informative and plausible CFs than the state-of-the-art for a wide range of environments and DRL agents.

It is one of the most pervasive and robust biases. Recently, literature has focused on knowing how influential the anchoring effect is when applied to information visualization, with studies finding its reproducibility in the field. Despite the extensive literature surrounding the anchoring effect’s robustness, there is still a need for research on which individual differences make people more susceptible. We explore how Locus of Control influences visualization’s ubiquitous and resilient anchoring effect. Locus of Control differentiates individuals who believe their life depends on their behavior or actions from those who blame outside factors such as destiny or luck for their life’s outcomes. We focus on the relationship between Locus of Control and the anchoring effect by exposing subjects to an anchor and analyzing their interaction with a complex visualization. Our results show that the anchoring strategies primed individuals and suggest that the Locus of Control plays a role in the susceptibility to the anchoring effect. © The Author(s) 2023.","anchoring effect; Cognitive bias; information visualization; locus of control; personality","Information analysis; Information systems; Anchoring effects; Anchorings; Cognitive bias; Individual Differences; Information visualization; Locus of control; Making decision; Over reliance; Personality; Reproducibilities; Visualization","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","14738716","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178277357"

However, there is little empirical guidance on the value or challenges of visualizing and integrating fairness metrics and algorithms into human-in-the-loop systems to aid decision-makers. In this work, we design a study to analyze the effectiveness of integrating such fairness metrics-based visualization and algorithms. We explore this through a task-based crowdsourced experiment comparing an interactive visualization system for constructing consensus rankings, ConsensusFuse, with a similar system that includes visual encodings of fairness metrics and fair-rank generation algorithms, FairFuse. We analyze the measure of fairness, agreement of rankers' decisions, and user interactions in constructing the fair consensus ranking across these two systems. In our study with 200 participants, results suggest that providing these fairness-oriented support features nudges users to align their decision with the fairness metrics while minimizing the tedious process of manually having to amend the consensus ranking. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of next-generation fairness oriented-systems and along with emerging directions for future research. © 2023 ACM.","empirical study; fairness; visualization","Decision making; Consensus ranking; Decision makers; Demographic groups; Empirical studies; Fairness; Human-in-the-loop; Loop systems; Multiple stakeholders; Sociodemographics; Task-based; Visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","","6th ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, FAccT 2023","12 June 2023 through 15 June 2023","Chicago","189310","","978-145037252-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163605119"

Prior to installing these applications, users are encouraged to read and comprehend the terms of service, which address important aspects such as data privacy, processes, and policies (referred to as information elements). However, these terms are often lengthy and complex, making it challenging for users to fully grasp their content. Additionally, existing transparency analytics tools typically rely on the manual extraction of information elements, resulting in a time-consuming process. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines information visualization and machine learning analyses to automate the retrieval of information elements. The methodology involves the creation and labeling of a dataset derived from multiple software terms of use. Machine learning models, including naïve Bayes, BART, and LSTM, are utilized for the classification of information elements and text summarization. Furthermore, the proposed approach is integrated into our existing visualization tool TranspVis to enable the automatic detection and display of software information elements. The system is thoroughly evaluated using a database-connected tool, incorporating various metrics and expert opinions. The results of our study demonstrate the promising potential of our approach, serving as an initial step in this field. Our solution not only addresses the challenge of extracting information elements from complex terms of service but also provides a foundation for future research in this area. © 2023 by the authors.","information visualization; machine learning; natural language processing; transparency analytics; visual analytics","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277390","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175111903"

Thereby, they potentially operate the underlying networks outside their validated domain, adding doubt in the predictor's abilities instead of generating knowledge and trust.

This is due to a lack of trust caused by information asymmetry: potential buyers struggle to assess the quality of a used phone. To remedy this, we designed Verifone, a third-party interface that offers device-specific information for second-hand phones. With 3D interactions emulating tangible experiences and data visualisations aiming to increase transparency of the phone condition, Verifone instills confidence in the buying process. Our research and design process focused on understanding what elements of functional and affective design elicited more trust in the phone's condition. User evaluations proved that a clean, standardized design combined with affective elements to highlight device uniqueness could inspire more confidence in assessing the device's condition. The positive response suggests a tool like Verifone could encourage sustainable purchases, contributing to a circular economy. In addition, our research also sheds light on effective information presentation styles that build trust within the context of second-hand electronic purchases. © 2024 Association for Computing Machinery.

Especially, monocular depth estimation networks are increasingly reliable in real-world scenes. In this work we investigate the applicability of such monocular depth estimation networks to semi-transparent volume rendered images. As depth is notoriously difficult to define in a volumetric scene without clearly defined surfaces, we consider different depth computations that have emerged in practice, and compare state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation approaches for these different interpretations during an evaluation considering different degrees of opacity in the renderings. Additionally, we investigate how these networks can be extended to further obtain color and opacity information, in order to create a layered representation of the scene based on a single color image. This layered representation consists of spatially separated semi-transparent intervals that composite to the original input rendering. In our experiments we show that existing approaches to monocular depth estimation can be adapted to perform well on semi-transparent volume renderings, which has several applications in the area of scientific visualization, like re-composition with additional objects and labels or additional shading. © 2023 The Authors.

Despite the high accuracy, they are often criticized for lacking explainability. There has been an increasing demand for understanding the decision-making process of deep face recognition systems. Recent studies have investigated the usage of visual saliency maps as an explanation, but they often lack a discussion and analysis in the context of face recognition. This paper concentrates on explainable face verification tasks and conceives a new explanation framework. Firstly, a definition of the saliency-based explanation method is provided, which focuses on the decisions made by the deep FR model. Secondly, a new model-agnostic explanation method named CorrRISE is proposed to produce saliency maps, which reveal both the similar and dissimilar regions of any given pair of face images. Then, an evaluation methodology is designed to measure the performance of general visual saliency explanation methods in face verification. Finally, substantial visual and quantitative results have shown that the proposed CorrRISE method demonstrates promising results in comparison with other state-of-the-art explainable face verification approaches. © 2024 IEEE.","accountable; Algorithms; Algorithms; Biometrics; body pose; ethical computer vision; Explainable; face; fair; gesture; privacy-preserving","Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Face recognition; Visualization; Accountable; Body pose; Ethical computer vision; Explainable; Face; Face Verification; Fair; Gesture; Privacy preserving; Visual saliency; Computer vision","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","CVF; IEEE Computer Society","2024 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2024","4 January 2024 through 8 January 2024","Waikoloa","198735","","979-835031892-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188719532"

Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts: single quantile dotplot (1-Dotplot), dual quantile dotplots (2-Dotplot), dual histogram intervals (2-Interval), and Plinko quantile dotplot (Plinko), an animated design with a physical and probabilistic analogy. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022, to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We use Bayesian multilevel modeling and post-stratification to produce demographically-representative estimates of people's emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people's intentions to participate in elections. 2-Interval shows the strongest effects across all measures; 1-Dotplot increases trust the most after elections. Both visualizations create emotional and trust gaps between different partisan identities, especially when a Republican candidate is predicted to win. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization. This intriguing interplay between visualization types, partisanship, and trust exemplifies the fundamental challenge of disentangling visualization from its context, underscoring a need for deeper investigation into the real-world impacts of visualizations.

Prior research has shown that visualizations of uncertainty can help to support better decision making. However, research has also shown that different representations of the same information can lead to different patterns of decision making. It is crucial for researchers to develop a better scientific understanding of when, why and how different representations of uncertainty lead viewers to make different decisions. This paper seeks to address this need by comparing geospatial visualizations of wildfire risk to verbal descriptions of the same risk. In three experiments, we manipulated the specificity of the uncertain information as well as the visual cues used to encode risk in the visualizations. All three experiments found that participants were more likely to evacuate in response to a hypothetical wildfire if the risk information was presented verbally. When the risk was presented visually, participants were less likely to evacuate, particularly when transparency was used to encode the risk information. Experiment 1 showed that evacuation rates were lower for transparency maps than for other types of visualizations. Experiments 2 and 3 sought to replicate this effect and to test how it related to other factors. Experiment 2 varied the hue used for the transparency maps and Experiment 3 manipulated the salience of the borders between the different risk levels. These experiments showed lower evacuation rates in response to transparency maps regardless of hue. The effect was partially, but not entirely, mitigated by adding salient borders to the transparency maps. Taken together, these experiments show that using transparency to encode information about risk can lead to very different patterns of decision making than other encodings of the same information. © 2024 Eurographics - The European Association for Computer Graphics and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CCS Concepts; • Human-centered computing → Empirical studies in visualization","Behavioral research; Decision making; Encoding (symbols); Fires; Signal encoding; Transparency; CCS concept; Decision-based; Decisions makings; Empirical studies; Human-centered computing; Risk information; Uncertain informations; Uncertainty; Visual encodings; • human-centered computing → empirical study in visualization; Visualization","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","01677055","","CGFOD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195504078"

However, existing ML-based DSS are not always transparent about the probabilistic nature of ML predictions and how uncertain each prediction is. This lack of transparency could give lay decision-makers a false sense of reliability. Growing calls for AI transparency have led to increasing efforts to quantify and communicate model uncertainty. However, there are still gaps in knowledge regarding how and why the decision-makers utilize ML uncertainty information in their decision process. Here, we conducted a qualitative, think-aloud user study with 17 lay decision-makers who interacted with three different DSS: 1) interactive visualization, 2) DSS based on an ML model that provides predictions without uncertainty information, and 3) the same DSS with uncertainty information. Our qualitative analysis found that communicating uncertainty about ML predictions forced participants to slow down and think analytically about their decisions. This in turn made participants more vigilant, resulting in reduction in over-reliance on ML-based DSS. Our work contributes empirical knowledge on how lay decision-makers perceive, interpret, and make use of uncertainty information when interacting with DSS. Such foundational knowledge informs the design of future ML-based DSS that embrace transparent uncertainty communication.  © 2023 ACM.","Decision-making; Machine Learning; Uncertainty","Decision support systems; Forecasting; Machine learning; Transparency; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Decision makers; Decision process; Decisions makings; Machine-learning; Modeling uncertainties; On-machines; Probabilistics; Think aloud; Uncertainty; Uncertainty informations; Decision making","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence (SIGAI); ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI)","28th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, IUI 2023","27 March 2023 through 31 March 2023","Sydney","187503","","979-840070106-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152132042"

However, concerns about model transparency and biases persist. Explainable methods are viewed as the solution to address these challenges. In this study, we introduce the Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis with Deep Feature Augmentation Subspace (OSA-DAS), a novel perturbation-based interpretability approach for computer vision. While traditional perturbation methods make only use of occlusions to explain the model predictions, OSA-DAS extends standard occlusion sensitivity analysis by enabling the integration with diverse image augmentations. Distinctly, our method utilizes the output vector of a DNN to build low-dimensional subspaces within the deep feature vector space, offering a more precise explanation of the model prediction. The structural similarity between these subspaces encompasses the influence of diverse augmentations and occlusions. We test extensively on the ImageNet-1k, and our class- and model-agnostic approach outperforms commonly used interpreters, setting it apart in the realm of explainable AI. © 2024 IEEE.","accountable; Algorithms; Algorithms; Applications; ethical computer vision; Explainable; fair; Image recognition and understanding; privacy-preserving; Visualization","Accidents; Computer vision; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Image recognition; Perturbation techniques; Vector spaces; Vectors; Accountable; Autonomous Vehicles; Ethical computer vision; Explainable; Fair; Feature space; Life-critical applications; Model prediction; Neural-networks; Privacy preserving; Sensitivity analysis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","CVF; IEEE Computer Society","2024 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2024","4 January 2024 through 8 January 2024","Waikoloa","198735","","979-835031892-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191940271"

However, evaluating MLLMs in low-level visual perception and understanding remains a yet-to-explore domain. To this end, we design benchmark settings to emulate human language responses related to low-level vision: the low-level visual perception (A1) via visual question answering related to low-level attributes (e.g. clarity, lighting); and the low-level visual description (A2), on evaluating MLLMs for low-level text descriptions. Furthermore, given that pairwise comparison can better avoid ambiguity of responses and has been adopted by many human experiments, we further extend the low-level perception-related questionanswering and description evaluations of MLLMs from single images to image pairs. Specifically, for perception (A1), we carry out the LLVisionQA&#x002B; dataset, comprising 2,990 single images and 1,999 image pairs each accompanied by an open-ended question about its low-level features; for description (A2), we propose the LLDescribe&#x002B; dataset, evaluating MLLMs for low-level descriptions on 499 single images and 450 pairs. Additionally, we evaluate MLLMs on assessment (A3) ability, i.e. predicting score, by employing a softmax-based approach to enable all MLLMs to generate quantifiable quality ratings, tested against human opinions in 7 image quality assessment (IQA) datasets. With 24 MLLMs under evaluation, we demonstrate that several MLLMs have decent low-level visual competencies on single images, but only GPT-4V exhibits higher accuracy on pairwise comparisons than single image evaluations (like humans). We hope that our benchmark will motivate further research into uncovering and enhancing these nascent capabilities of MLLMs. Datasets will be available at https:&#x002F;&#x002F;github.com&#x002F;Q-Future&#x002F;Q-Bench.

However, a portion of society, such as the visually impaired, still face major challenges in Information Systems (IS) on the Web regarding access to information in dynamic images. Problem: These citizens, in general, cannot understand the information described in these images, so that they can build a mental model. You need to provide alternative ways of describing them. Solution: In this article, studies were explored that could help in the description of dynamic images under the pillars of understanding, transparency of information and perception for the construction of SIs for the visually impaired. SI theory: This work follows the protocols adopted for systematic mapping directed to meta-analysis and hermeneutics. Method: A Systematic Mapping of the Literature was used following the steps of planning, conducting and analyzing the results. Summary Results: From the search repositories, 1019 studies were captured. After applying the evaluation criteria, 11 relevant studies were accepted. The results revealed that there are few studies in the development of technologies that use methods, models and techniques for the description of dynamic images. Contributions to IS: As a contribution, this work exposes research gaps for the creation of ISs that include descriptions in dynamic images for the understanding and transparency of perceptible information to people with visual impairments.

This issue is increasingly on the agenda both at company and at individual level. Cybersecurity and Privacy - bridging the gap addresses two very complex fields of the digital world, i.e., Cybersecurity and Privacy. These multifaceted, multidisciplinary and complex issues are usually understood and valued differently by different individuals, data holders and legal bodies. But a change in one field immediately affects the others. Policies, frameworks, strategies, laws, tools, techniques, and technologies - all of these are tightly interwoven when it comes to security and privacy.

Gender is a common demographic dimension of data collected from study or survey participants, passengers, or customers, as well as across academic studies, especially in certain disciplines like sociology. Our work contributes to multiple ongoing discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing specific data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may, inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from five different scientific communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we found that representation types are community-specific, color hue is the dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is under-represented. We end our paper with a discussion of considerations for gender visualization derived from our coding and the literature and recommendations for large data collection bodies.

Realizing this potential requires methods which take into account the specific properties of such data, for example, its heterogeneity, subjectivity, and spatial resolution but also temporal relevance and bias. The aim of the chapter is to show how insights into human behavior can be gained from location-based social media and movement data using visual analysis methods. A conceptual behavioral model is introduced that summarizes people's reactions under the influence of one or more events. In addition, influencing factors are described using a context model, which makes it possible to analyze visitation and mobility patterns with regard to spatial, temporal, and thematic-attribute changes. Selected generic methods are presented, such as extended time curves and the cobridge metaphor to perform comparative analysis along time axes. Furthermore, it is shown that emojis can be used as contextual indicants to analyze sentiment and emotions in relation to events and locations. © The Author(s) 2024.

Some existing models utilize the extensive visual and textual modal knowledge of vision-language pre-trained models (VLPs) to compensate for the data scarcity problem. However, they may suffer from a classification bias problem during the fusion of multi-modal information since that they focus on the inter-modal matching while neglecting intra-modal recognition for few-shot images. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot model with mixed-modal prototypes by partial-tuning the VLPs for better information fusion. It aims to yield a high-quality class prototype representation by integrating the abundant multi-modal knowledge of VLPs and the specific-task information of low-shot visual data. Specifically, we introduce an image-text alignment module to ensure the consistency of the few-shot visual representation and the textual knowledge of VLPs at the feature space. A self-similar learning module is designed to excavate the local and detailed characters of specific class, which is crucial under the data scarcity. Additionally, to preserve the generalizable pre-trained knowledge in the maximum extent, we partial-tune the parameters of VLPs to adapt for the few-shot tasks. To sum up, we mix multi-modal information at the feature representation level instead of fusing multi-modal matching similarities, which effectively mitigates classification bias and ultimately enhances the model performance for few-shot data. The extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on 11 benchmark datasets and the results show its promising.  © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Few-shot learning; multi-modal learning; partial-tuning; vision-language pre-trained models","Data visualization; Job analysis; Learning systems; Visual languages; Adaptation models; And vision-language pre-trained model; Classification bias; Data scarcity; Few-shot learning; Metalearning; Multi-modal learning; Partial-tuning; Prototype; Task analysis; Classification (of information)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15209210","","ITMUF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190344352"

Methods: We created methods for transforming raw data into a data framework for applying machine learning and natural language processing techniques for predicting falls and fractures. Strategies such as inclusion and reporting for multiple races, mixed data sources such as outpatient, inpatient, structured codes, and unstructured notes, and addressing missingness were applied to raw data to promote a reduction in bias. The raw data was carefully curated using validated definitions to create data variables such as age, race, gender, and healthcare utilization. For the formation of these variables, clinical, statistical, and data expertise were used. The research team included a variety of experts with diverse professional and demographic backgrounds to include diverse perspectives. Results: For the prediction of falls, information extracted from radiology reports was converted to a matrix for applying machine learning. The processing of the data resulted in an input of 5,377,673 reports to the machine learning algorithm, out of which 45,304 were flagged as positive and 5,332,369 as negative for falls. Processed data resulted in lower missingness and a better representation of race and diagnosis codes. For fractures, specialized algorithms extracted snippets of text around keywork “femoral” from dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to identify femoral neck T-scores that are important for predicting fracture risk. The natural language processing algorithms yielded 98% accuracy and 2% error rate The methods to prepare data for input to artificial intelligence processes are reproducible and can be applied to other studies. Conclusion: The life cycle of data from raw to analytic form includes data governance, cleaning, management, and analysis. When applying artificial intelligence methods, input data must be prepared optimally to reduce algorithmic bias, as biased output is harmful. Building AI-ready data frameworks that improve efficiency can contribute to transparency and reproducibility. The roadmap for the application of AI involves applying specialized techniques to input data, some of which are suggested here. This study highlights data curation aspects to be considered when preparing data for the application of artificial intelligence to reduce bias. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Data preparation; Diversity; Fairness; Inclusion","Accidental Falls; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Electronic Health Records; Female; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Codes (symbols); Data reduction; Data visualization; Forecasting; Fracture; Input output programs; Life cycle; Machine learning; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligence methods; Data framework; Data preparation; Diversity; Electronic health; Fairness; Input datas; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Roadmap; adult; age distribution; aged; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical evaluation; clinical research; cohort analysis; controlled study; data processing; demographics; electronic health record; fairness; female; fracture; gender; health care utilization; hip fracture; hospital patient; human; humerus fracture; machine learning; male; measurement accuracy; medical expert; middle aged; natural language processing; outpatient; prediction; race; radiology; risk factor; spine fracture; wrist fracture; X ray absorptiometry; algorithm; electronic health record; falling; machine learning; natural language processing; prevention and control; Learning algorithms","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","15320464","","JBIOB","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193075830"

Even though such automatically synthesized ML pipelines are able to achieve competitive performance, recent studies have shown that users do not trust models constructed by AutoML due to missing transparency of AutoML systems and missing explanations for the constructed ML pipelines. In a requirements analysis study with 36 domain experts, data scientists, and AutoML researchers from different professions with vastly different expertise in ML, we collect detailed informational needs for AutoML. We propose XAutoML, an interactive visual analytics tool for explaining arbitrary AutoML optimization procedures and ML pipelines constructed by AutoML. XAutoML combines interactive visualizations with established techniques from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to make the complete AutoML procedure transparent and explainable. By integrating XAutoML with JupyterLab, experienced users can extend the visual analytics with ad-hoc visualizations based on information extracted from XAutoML. We validate our approach in a user study with the same diverse user group from the requirements analysis.

The experimental results show that, when the pile has a variable cross-section and inclination angle, the friction resistance on both sides of the pile increases. The vertical-load-carrying capacity of the 2% and 4% inclined piles with a variable cross-section is greater than that of the piles with inclinations greater than 8%. For model piles with the degrees of inclination of 2% and 4%, the variable-section inclined piles with diameters of 17 mm and 15 mm show significantly less settlement than the equal-section inclined piles. For the model pile with an inclination of 8%, the settlement of the inclined piles with a variable cross-section diameter of 17 mm is slightly smaller than that of the equal cross-section inclined piles. The change in variable cross-section and inclination angle has a large effect on the soil displacement around the pile, and the conclusions of this paper can provide guidance for the engineering application of variable cross-section piles. © 2024 by the authors.","inclination; pile; PIV technology; transparent soil; variable; visualization","Bearing capacity; Flow visualization; Soils; Velocity measurement; Bearing mechanisms; Inclination; Inclination angles; Model tests; Particle image velocimetry technologies; Technology and designs; Test study; Transparent soils; Variable; Variable cross section; Piles","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20763417","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199593004"

However, people with severe visual impairment still face barriers on the Web when it comes to accessing the information presented in these graphics. Problem: This part of society cannot understand the information described in these visual contents, meaning they cannot graphically construct a mental model. Solution: Recommendations for improvements grouped into four categories covering familiarity with the use of keys, web content, understanding of information, preference for descriptions encoded in two categories (captions and values; color), navigation features, ways of acquiring descriptions, dissemination of information. SI Theory: This article was conceived under the umbrella of Software Systems Theory. Method: This work is empirical in nature with a qualitative methodological approach, in which direct observation and various research strategies, techniques and analysis of results were used. Summary Results: Based on a web survey with 41 participants and a subsequent field study with the participation of 12 people with visual impairments, the demands and preferences of these citizens were determined, based on tests carried out on portals at three government levels (municipal, state and federal) and semi-structured interviews. Contributions to SI: As a contribution, this article can assist research in Information Systems aiming at describing dynamic graphics from the perspective of information transparency for the understanding of citizens with visual impairments, in addition to promoting research in HCI and related areas aligned with GranDSI-BR 2016 -2026.

Their prototype learning scheme enables intuitive explanations of the form, this (prototype) looks like that (testing image patch). But, does this actually look like that? In this work, we delve into why object part localization and associated heat maps in past work are misleading. Rather than localizing to object parts, existing ProtoPartNNs localize to the entire image, contrary to generated explanatory visualizations. We argue that detraction from these underlying issues is due to the alluring nature of visualizations and an over-reliance on intuition. To alleviate these issues, we devise new receptive field-based architectural constraints for meaningful localization and a principled pixel space mapping for ProtoPartNNs. To improve interpretability, we propose additional architectural improvements, including a simplified classification head. We also make additional corrections to ProtoPNet and its derivatives, such as the use of a validation set, rather than a test set, to evaluate generalization during training. Our approach, PixPNet (Pixel-grounded Prototypical part Network), is the only ProtoPartNN that truly learns and localizes to prototypical object parts.

Various robotic systems have been developed to achieve the required precision and, in combination with intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) imaging, methods for autonomous robotic guidance have been proposed. In such systems, the robot's cognition is often governed by machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which provide semantic scene information from iOCT images. Although the robot performs a surgical task autonomously, human supervision is critical to monitor the robot's execution and, if necessary, stop the robot or take control to avoid trauma to the patient. In this paper, we propose a novel visualization concept for improved human supervision of autonomous robotic subretinal injection that integrates uncertainty information of the data provided to the robot. We design a focus and context visualization that renders an automatically identified instrument-aligned B-scan in the context of the 3D OCT volume. Our visualization is enriched by augmenting the uncertainty information on the instrument-aligned B-scan. To dynamically model task-specific uncertainty, we introduce a weighting scheme to assign an importance factor to each pair of classes, controlling the impact of their confusion on the overall uncertainty. We demonstrate our visualization concept on iOCT volumes acquired at different stages during subretinal injection on ex-vivo porcine eyes. We show that our processing pipeline achieves sufficient update rates for surgical display and discuss the impact of our visualization concept on the acceptance of robotic task autonomy for subretinal injection procedures. © 2024 IEEE.","Acceptability and Trust; Medical Robots and Systems; Safety in HRI","Convolutional neural networks; Medical robotics; Optical tomography; Robot learning; Robotic surgery; Visualization; Acceptability and trust; Autonomous robotics; Coherence tomography; Human supervision; Intra-operative; Medical robots and systems; Optical-; Safety in HRI; Uncertainty; Uncertainty informations; Optical coherence tomography","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Beijing NOKOV Science and Technology Co., Ltd.; et al.; Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.; Kuka AG; Schunk SE and Co.

We have developed a 3D multi-view transparent visualization using edge highlighting as visual guide, improving accuracy of perceived depth for reliable visual analyses of the 3D scanned point clouds. When transparently visualizing a 3D object on a 3D multi-view display, the depth information tends to become less distinct. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether emphasizing the statistically extracted 3D edges of the scanned object can enhance the perceived depth of transparently visualized 3D objects. We conducted psychophysical experiments where participants were asked to report their perceived magnitudes of depth for multiple types of 3D structures of cultural heritage presented on a multi-view 3D display. The results indicated that our edge highlighting reduced the underestimation of depth from 46.8% to 34.0% on average. This improvement persisted even when the 3D structures produced an atypical linear perspective, normally caused by reverse depths, where the front and back are reversed. These findings suggest that edge highlighting brings us an effective visual guide to improve the accuracy of perceived depths on a 3D multi-view display.  © 2024 The Author(s).","depth perception; edge highlighting; Transparent multi-view 3D visualization; visual guide","Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; Visualization; 3D object; 3D Structure; 3D Visualization; Edge highlighting; Laser scanned; Multi-views; Multiview displays; Point-clouds; Transparent multi-view 3d visualization; Visual guide; Depth perception","World Scientific","","","","","","17939623","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185812294"

In particular, confirmation bias can cause people to overweigh information that confirms their beliefs, and dismiss information that disconfirms them. We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowdworkers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. We created two scenarios, one in which we primed people with a belief before asking them to make a decision, and another in which people held pre-existing beliefs. The data was presented as either a table, a bar table, or a bar chart. To correctly solve the problem, participants should use a complex reasoning strategy to compare two ratios, each between two pairs of values. But participants could also be tempted to use simpler, superficial heuristics, shortcuts, or biased strategies to reason about the problem. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. These findings suggest that data presentation formats can affect affordances for reasoning. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Data visualization; empirical evaluation; reasoning; tabular displays","Adult; Computer Graphics; Data Visualization; Female; Humans; Male; Problem Solving; Thinking; Young Adult; Visualization; Affordances; Bar chart; Cognition; Confirmation bias; Empirical evaluations; Presentation formats; Reasoning; Tabular display; Urban areas; Weapon; adult; computer graphics; data visualization; female; human; male; physiology; problem solving; thinking; young adult; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146253564"

The datasets used for training speech models often represent demographic features of the speaker-such as gender, age, and accent. These axes are frequently used to evaluate the training set and model for bias [52]. Here, we focus on how accent is represented in voice data due to the adverse consequences of accent bias. We perform document analysis on several voice datasets to identify how accents are currently represented. We then analyse and visualise speaker-described accents from Mozilla's Common Voice (CV) v13 English dataset, forming an emergent taxonomy of accent descriptors. We repeat this process using the CV v13 Kiswahili dataset, demonstrating that the taxonomy has use beyond English. We find that accents are currently represented in ways that are geographically, and predominantly, nationally bound. While this pattern is also shown in speaker-described accents from CV, a more diverse set of descriptors is revealed. This work provides some early evidence for re-thinking how accents are represented in datasets intended for ML applications. Our tooling is open-sourced, and we invite further work that uses our taxonomy to assess accent bias in speech data and models. © 2023 Owner/Author.","accent bias; accent data; accent recognition; bias; bias corpora; data visualization; dataset documentation; datasets; metadata; speech data; voice data","Metadata; Speech recognition; Taxonomies; Accent bias; Accent data; Accent recognition; Bias; Bias corpus; Dataset; Dataset documentation; Speech data; Speech models; Voice data; Data visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","et al.; PITcases; Schmidt Futures; SIGAI; SIGecom; University of California","2023 ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization, EAAMO 2023","30 October 2023 through 1 November 2023","Boston","193914","","979-840070381-2","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177815597"

Among other advantages, it increases model transparency and intelligibility for all categories of users including non-experts, and it can be used by modellers as a tool to debug models in development. However, simulation visualisation is often tightly coupled to specific simulators, and, therefore, there is no way to reuse visualisation tools efficiently.

Machine Learning (ML) shows great potential for trust evaluation owing to its learning capabilities. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as a new ML paradigm, have demonstrated superiority in dealing with graph data. This has motivated researchers to explore their use in trust evaluation, as trust relationships among entities can be modeled as a graph. However, current trust evaluation methods that employ GNNs fail to fully satisfy the dynamic nature of trust, overlook the adverse effects of trust-related attacks, and cannot provide convincing explanations on evaluation results. To address these problems, we propose TrustGuard, a GNN-based accurate trust evaluation model that supports trust dynamicity, is robust against typical attacks, and provides explanations through visualization. Specifically, TrustGuard is designed with a layered architecture that contains a snapshot input layer, a spatial aggregation layer, a temporal aggregation layer, and a prediction layer. Among them, the spatial aggregation layer adopts a defense mechanism to robustly aggregate local trust, and the temporal aggregation layer applies an attention mechanism for effective learning of temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that TrustGuard outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based trust evaluation models with respect to trust prediction across single-timeslot and multi-timeslot, even in the presence of attacks. In addition, TrustGuard can explain its evaluation results by visualizing both spatial and temporal views.

Based on the research and analysis of the three-dimensional space of the urban landscape space, the three-dimensional space can not only allow users to intuitively perceive the development of the city. It also enables decision makers, planners, and users to more intuitively, objectively, and rationally recognize and understand the current urban development and planning design. Defining the data content of the 3D city landscape image model is the basis for creating the 3D city image model. It not only guides producers to select data, but also serves as the basis for sharing data between different applications. With the continuous development of society, the number of people living in rural areas migrating to cities to make a living has increased rapidly, leading to the growing problem of 'urban congestion' in many areas. In order to effectively solve these problems, 'smart cities' came into being. It quickly triggered a boom in global urban development. Based on a survey of the state-of-the-art in the field of 3D modeling and engineering design visualization, this paper analyzes 3D rendering acceleration algorithms used to speed up rendering and improve the quality of 3D design. By utilizing BSP technology, transparent objects can be drawn in any order in any scene, which solves the problem of incorrectly occluding transparent objects during rendering. This paper also applies collision detection technology, which enhances the user's immersive feeling when roaming the landscape. In the 3D reconstruction process, it can complete the column and wall recognition for the test image with complex composition.

While common wisdom suggests that recontextualizing visualizations with metadata (e.g., disclosing the data source or instructions for decoding the visualizations' encoding) may counter these effects, the impact remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, we explored how chart type, topic, and user goal impacted which categories of metadata participants deemed most relevant. We presented 64 participants with four real-world visualizations. For each visualization, participants were given four goals and selected the type of metadata they most wanted from a set of 18 types. Our results indicated that participants were most interested in metadata which explained the visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding and metadata about the source of the data for assessing trustworthiness. In Experiment 2, we explored how these two types of metadata impact transparency, trustworthiness and persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding. We asked 144 participants to explain the main message of two pairs of visualizations (one with metadata and one without); rate them on scales of transparency and relevance; and then predict the likelihood that they were selected for a presentation to policymakers. Our results suggested that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough than those without metadata, but similarly relevant, accurate, clear, and complete. Additionally, we found that metadata did not impact the accuracy of the information extracted from visualizations, but may have influenced which information participants remembered as important or interesting. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Metadata; transparency; trust; understanding; visualization","Data mining; Data visualization; Encoding (symbols); Signal encoding; Transparency; Visualization; Data-source; Encodings; Information relevances; Information understanding; Real-world; Soft sensors; Stakeholder; Trust; Understanding; User goals; adult; article; data visualization; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; metadata; Metadata","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146224435"

This trend constitutes in a fundamental change of going from mechanical and electrical engineering towards software-driven approaches. Modern vehicles can embed more than hundred electronic control units (ECUs). As autonomous vehicles require more intelligence as well as more computing power, high-performance computers (HPCs) bring the data management capabilities for cloud and IoT services to support the transition to a service-oriented vehicle system architecture. With this growing reliance on software in vehicles, software reliability and trustworthiness are increasingly critical to vehicle security. Measuring security trustworthiness in automotive software is even more valuable as cybersecurity is shifting to the left, i.e. in the early phase of development and design process. In this article, we propose a novel method for evaluating security trustworthiness of automotive software by leveraging a computational trust model. The method consists of selecting different domains contributing to software security, calculating their respective expectation value (trustworthiness score) and combining it using operators from the computational trust model. We evaluate the method using an automotive use case, i.e. over-the-air (OTA) update software.

In human–computer decision-making applications, users’ perceptions of system reliability may deviate from the probabilistic characteristics. Intuitive visualization of system recognition results within probability distributions can serve to enhance interpretability and support cognitive processes. Different visualization formats may impact users’ reliability perceptions and cognitive abilities. This study first compared the mapping relationship between users’ perceived values of system recognition results and the actual probabilistic characteristics of the distribution when using density strips, violin plots, and error bars to visualize normal distributions. The findings indicate that when density strips are used for visualization, users’ perceptions align most closely with the probabilistic integrals, exhibiting the shortest response times and highest cognitive arousal. However, users’ perceptions often exceed the actual probability density, with an average coefficient of 2.53 times, unaffected by the form of uncertainty visualization. Conversely, this perceptual bias did not appear in triangular distributions and remained consistent across symmetric and asymmetric distributions. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of user reliability perception for interaction designers, helping to improve uncertainty visualization and thereby mitigate perceptual biases and potential trust risks. © 2024 by the authors.","human–computer interaction design; human–computer trust; reliability perception; uncertainty visualization; user study","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","20738994","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202493288"

Unlike the current state-of-the-art method, which heavily relies on the accuracy of a pure visual SLAM system to estimate inertial variables without updating camera poses, potentially compromising accuracy and robustness, our approach offers a different solution. We realize the crucial impact of precise gyroscope bias estimation on rotation accuracy. This, in turn, affects trajectory accuracy due to the accumulation of translation errors. To address this, we first independently estimate the gyroscope bias and use it to formulate a maximum a posteriori problem for further refinement. After this refinement, we proceed to update the rotation estimation by performing IMU integration with gyroscope bias removed from gyroscope measurements. We then leverage robust and accurate rotation estimates to enhance translation estimation via 3-DoF bundle adjustment. Moreover, we introduce a novel approach for determining the success of the initialization by evaluating the residual of the normal epipolar constraint. Extensive evaluations on the EuRoC dataset illustrate that our method excels in accuracy and robustness. It outperforms ORB-SLAM3, the current leading stereo visual-inertial initialization method, in terms of absolute trajectory error and relative rotation error, while maintaining competitive computational speed. Notably, even with 5 keyframes for initialization, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art approach using 10 keyframes in rotation accuracy.

Using the three classes, bias is identified in these studies based on 44 critical AI attributes. Bias in the AI-models is computed by analytical, butterfly, and ranking-based bias models. These bias models were evaluated using two experts and compared using variability analysis. AI-studies that lacked sufficient AI-attributes are more prone to risk-of-bias (RoB) in all three classes. Studies with high RoB loses fins in the butterfly model. It has been analyzed that the majority of the studies in healthcare suffer from data bias and algorithmic bias due to incomplete specifications mentioned in the design protocol and weak AI design exploited for prediction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithmic bias; Bias accountability; Bias visualization; Data bias; Legal manifestations; Mitigating bias","Data visualization; Systems analysis; Algorithmic bias; Algorithmics; Bias accountability; Bias modeling; Bias visualization; Data bias; Intelligence models; Legal manifestation; Medical systems; Mitigating bias; Artificial intelligence","Springer","","","","","","13807501","","MTAPF","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165576099"

In this work, a unified method named Balanced Embedding Discrimination Maximization (BEDM) is developed to make the intermediate embedding more distinctive. Specifically, we utilize an orthogonality constraint based on doubly-blocked Toeplitz matrix to minimize the correlation of convolution kernels, and an algorithm for similarity visualization is introduced. Furthermore, uneven samples and distribution shift among old and new tasks eventuate strongly biased classifiers. To mitigate the imbalance, we propose an adaptive balance weighting in softmax to compensate insufficient categories dynamically. In addition, hybrid embedding learning is introduced to preserve knowledge from old models, which involves less hyper-parameters than conventional knowledge distillation. Our proposed method outperforms the existing approaches on three mainstream benchmark datasets. Moreover, we technically visualize that our method can produce a more uniform similarity histogram and more stable spectrum. Grad-CAM and t-SNE visualizations further confirm its effectiveness.

Drawing from the information processing and stimulus-organism-response theory, we investigate through two experimental between-subjects studies how process explanations and process visualizations—as additional information provision measures—affect users’ perceived fairness and behavioral responses to VAPRs. We find that process explanations have a positive effect on fairness perceptions, whereas process visualizations do not.

As a consequence, disparate stakeholders need to interact with and make informed decisions about using machine learning models in everyday systems. Visualization technology can support stakeholders in understanding and evaluating trade-offs between, for example, accuracy and fairness of models. This paper aims to empirically answer 'Can visualization design choices affect a stakeholder's perception of model bias, trust in a model, and willingness to adopt a model?' Through a series of controlled, crowd-sourced experiments with more than 1,500 participants, we identify a set of strategies people follow in deciding which models to trust. Our results show that men and women prioritize fairness and performance differently and that visual design choices significantly affect that prioritization. For example, women trust fairer models more often than men do, participants value fairness more when it is explained using text than as a bar chart, and being explicitly told a model is biased has a bigger impact than showing past biased performance. We test the generalizability of our results by comparing the effect of multiple textual and visual design choices and offer potential explanations of the cognitive mechanisms behind the difference in fairness perception and trust.

These systems rely on inputs dynamically queried from people to enhance classification. Ensuring appropriate analyst trust in these systems presents a significant obstacle as analyst over- or underreliance may adversely affect a given application. Common AL strategies enhance classification models by asking analysts to provide labels for data points with the highest degree of uncertainty. However, such model-centric policies do not consider potential priming effects on the analyst and how they will affect people's trust in the system post-training. We present an empirical study assessing how AL query policies and visualizations that enhance transparency in a classifier's decisions influence trust in automated image classifiers. We found that query policy may significantly influence an analyst's perception of system capabilities, while the level of visual transparency into classifier certainty may influence an analyst's ability to perform a classification task. Our study informs the design of interactive labeling systems to help mitigate the effects of overreliance and calibrate appropriate trust in automated systems. © 2024 ACM.","Autonomous agent; Human-AI collaboration; Human-AI teams","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Autonomous agents; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Active learning strategies; Active learning systems; Environmental Monitoring; Geo-spatial analysis; Human-AI collaboration; Human-AI team; Machine-learning; Monitoring analysis; Policy visualisation; Uncertainty visualization; Transparency","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGAI; ACM SIGCHI; Adobe; Google; Michelin; National Science Foundation (NSF)","29th Annual Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, IUI 2024","18 March 2024 through 21 March 2024","Greenville","198805","","979-840070508-3","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191001672"

As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper - educators and researchers in data visualization - identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world: viseducationchallenges.github.io.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Challenges; Data Visualization; Education","Digital storage; Visualization; Art; Challenge; Communities of learners; Complex nature; Creativity; Cultural difference; Diverse community; Personal lives; Professional life; Tacit knowledge; article; data visualization; education; human; human experiment; motivation; responsibility; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175229487"

Design/methodology/approach: To verify the effectiveness of KGAT-PO, a counterbalanced design was applied to compare research participants in two groups using DHRP-BCMP with and without KGAT-PO, respectively, to perform people relationship inquiry and to see if there were significant differences in the effectiveness and efficiency of exploring relationships between people, and the use of technology acceptance between the two groups. Interviews and Lag Sequential Analysis were also used to observe research participants’ perceptions and behaviors. Findings: The results show that the DHRP-BCMP with KGAT-PO could help research participants improve the effectiveness of exploring relationships between people, and the research participants showed high technology acceptance towards using DHRP-BCMP with KGAT-PO. Moreover, the research participants who used DHRP-BCMP with KGAT-PO could identify helpful textual patterns to explore people’s relationships more quickly than DHRP-BCMP without KGAT-PO. The interviews revealed that most research participants agreed that the KGAT-PO is a good starting point for exploring relationships between people and improves the effectiveness and efficiency of exploring people’s relationship networks. Research limitations/implications: The research’s limitations encompass challenges related to data quality, complex people relationships, and privacy and ethics concerns. Currently, the KGAT-PO is limited to recognizing eight types of person-to-person relationships, including couple, sibling, parent-child, friend, teacher-student, relative, work, and others. These factors should be carefully considered to ensure the tool’s accuracy, usability, and ethical application in enhancing digital humanities research. Practical implications: The study’s practical implications encompass enhanced research efficiency, aiding humanities scholars in uncovering latent interpersonal relationships within historical texts with high technology acceptance. Additionally, the tool’s applications can extend to social sciences, business and marketing, educational settings, and innovative research directions, ultimately contributing to data-driven insights in the field of digital humanities. Originality/value: The research’s originality lies in creating a Knowledge Graph Analysis Tool of People and Organizations (KGAT-PO) using AI, bridging the gap between digital humanities research and AI technology. Its value is evident in its potential to efficiently uncover hidden people relationships, aiding digital humanities scholars in gaining new insights and perspectives, ultimately enhancing the depth and effectiveness of their research. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digital humanities; Information visualization; Knowledge graph; Lag sequence analysis; Relationships between people and organizations; Text mining","Behavioral research; Efficiency; Ethical technology; Analysis tools; Digital humanities; Graph analysis; Humanities research; Information visualization; Knowledge graphs; Lag sequence analyse; Relationship between people and organization; Sequence analysis; Text-mining; Knowledge graph","Emerald Publishing","","","","","","25149288","","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200542262"

To reduce these language biases, recent VQA works introduce an auxiliary question-only model to regularize the training of targeted VQA model, and achieve dominating performance on diagnostic benchmarks for out-of-distribution testing. However, due to the complex model design, ensemble-based methods are unable to equip themselves with two indispensable characteristics of an ideal VQA model: 1) Visual-explainable: The model should rely on the right visual regions when making decisions. 2) Question-sensitive: The model should be sensitive to the linguistic variations in questions. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing and Training (CSST) strategy. After training with CSST, VQA models are forced to focus on all critical objects and words, which significantly improves both visual-explainable and question-sensitive abilities. Specifically, CSST is composed of two parts: Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CSS) and Counterfactual Samples Training (CST). CSS generates counterfactual samples by carefully masking critical objects in images or words in questions and assigning pseudo ground-truth answers. CST not only trains the VQA models with both complementary samples to predict respective ground-truth answers, but also urges the VQA models to further distinguish the original samples and superficially similar counterfactual ones. To facilitate the CST training, we propose two variants of supervised contrastive loss for VQA, and design an effective positive and negative sample selection mechanism based on CSS. Extensive experiments have shown the effectiveness of CSST.

This study focused on SD at the local public administration (LPA) level with the objective of determining how SDGs are implemented by LPAs, including examining administrative actors’ roles as coordinators of public goods and initiatives focused on convincing all stakeholders to participate actively in cocreating solutions to social, economic, and environmental problems. The relevant literature’s most prominent research topics and their evolution were explored using bibliometric techniques (i.e., evaluation, relational analysis, and the visualization of bibliometric elements using VOSviewer software (version 1.6.18)). The results suggest that the process of implementing SDGs presents LPAs with a set of challenges, concerns, and restrictions.

However, existing visualization methods are not always effective and efficient in representing bivariate graph-based data. This study proposes a novel node-link visual model – visual entropy (Vizent) graph – to effectively represent both primary and secondary values, such as uncertainty, on the edges simultaneously. We performed two user studies to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in the context of static node-link diagrams. In the first experiment, we evaluated the performance of the Vizent design to determine if it performed equally well or better than existing alternatives in terms of response time and accuracy. Three static visual encodings that use two visual cues were selected from the literature for comparison: Width-Lightness, Saturation-Transparency, and Numerical values. We compared the Vizent design to the selected visual encodings on various graphs ranging in complexity from 5 to 25 edges for three different tasks. The participants achieved higher accuracy of their responses using Vizent and Numerical values; however, both Width-Lightness and Saturation-Transparency did not show equal performance for all tasks. Our results suggest that increasing graph size has no impact on Vizent in terms of response time and accuracy. The performance of the Vizent graph was then compared to the Numerical values visualization. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that mean response time in seconds was significantly less when the Vizent graphs were presented, while no significant difference in accuracy was found. The results from the experiments are encouraging and we believe justify using the Vizent graph as a good alternative to traditional methods for representing bivariate data in the context of node-link diagrams. © 2023 The Author(s)","Bivariate network visualization; Edge visualization; Node-link diagram; Quantitative evaluation; Uncertainty visualization","Data visualization; Decision making; Encoding (symbols); Graph theory; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Bivariate; Bivariate datum; Bivariate network visualization; Edge visualization; Network visualization; Node-link diagrams; Numerical values; Performance; Quantitative evaluation; Uncertainty visualization; Transparency","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","25432656","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171992867"

These limitations are further exacerbated when dealing with the high dimensionality introduced by the temporal dimension. While there are surveys analyzing the advances of Transformers for vision, none focus on an in-depth analysis of video-specific designs. In this survey, we analyze the main contributions and trends of works leveraging Transformers to model video. Specifically, we delve into how videos are handled at the input level first. Then, we study the architectural changes made to deal with video more efficiently, reduce redundancy, re-introduce useful inductive biases, and capture long-term temporal dynamics. In addition, we provide an overview of different training regimes and explore effective self-supervised learning strategies for video. Finally, we conduct a performance comparison on the most common benchmark for Video Transformers (i.e., action classification), finding them to outperform 3D ConvNets even with less computational complexity.  © 1979-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence; computer vision; self-attention; transformers; video representations","Benchmarking; Electric transformers; Job analysis; Visualization; Inductive bias; Long range interactions; Longer-range interaction; Market researches; Self-attention; Task analysis; Tokenization; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Video representations; article; convolutional neural network; learning; videorecording; vision; Computer vision","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","01628828","","ITPID","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149358445"

Existing de-bias learning frameworks try to capture specific dataset bias by annotations but they fail to handle complicated OOD scenarios. Others implicitly identify the dataset bias by special design low capability biased models or losses, but they degrade when the training and testing data are from the same distribution. In this paper, we propose a General Greedy De-bias learning framework (GGD), which greedily trains the biased models and base model. The base model is encouraged to focus on examples that are hard to solve with biased models, thus remaining robust against spurious correlations in the test stage. GGD largely improves models' OOD generalization ability on various tasks, but sometimes over-estimates the bias level and degrades on the in-distribution test. We further re-analyze the ensemble process of GGD and introduce the Curriculum Regularization inspired by curriculum learning, which achieves a good trade-off between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution performance. Extensive experiments on image classification, adversarial question answering, and visual question answering demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. GGD can learn a more robust base model under the settings of both task-specific biased models with prior knowledge and self-ensemble biased model without prior knowledge.

The analysis of activation maps of each CAM method and EnsembleCAM confirmed that in activation maps of EnsembleCAM, higher activation values were more concentrated around the nucleus which is the most important region in indicating cervical malignancy. The evaluation using pixel flipping performance metric also proved that the EnsembleCAM effectively recognises regions vital to the model's decision-making through its steepest drop in the mean prediction score when the pixels in the region contributing most to the model's decision were flipped. © 2024 IEEE.","class activation maps; ensemble explanations; explainable artificial intelligence; medical image classification; transparent classification visualization","Activation analysis; Chemical activation; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Deep learning; Diseases; Image classification; Medical imaging; Pixels; Activation maps; Cervical cancers; Class activation map; Ensemble explanation; Explainable artificial intelligence; Learning models; Map methods; Medical image classification; Pap smear; Transparent classification visualization; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2024 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering, SCSE 2024","4 April 2024","Colombo","200160","","979-835037568-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196708188"

However, the lack of interpretability limits the application of multimodal models, especially for those that require the security of systems, data, and users. A key challenge in enhancing the interpretability of the models is the trade-off between transparency and model performance in terms of accuracy and computing efficiency. We propose a vision-language multimodal pretrained model called Multiway-Fuzzy-Experts Bidirectional Retention Network (VL-MFER), which is designed to effectively interpret model decision processes while enhancing the consistent mapping between text and image features. We first propose a bidirectional retention network to handle and integrate the cross-modal high-dimensional data, which can effectively enhance both the performance and inference efficiency. Then, to improve the interpretability of vision-language pretrained models such as the unified vision-language pretraining with mixture-of-modality-experts (VLMo), we propose a multiway fuzzy experts pool based on multiple different layered deep neuro-fuzzy systems for diverse downstream tasks. After training on diverse datasets consisting of images, text, and paired image-text data, we fine-tuned models for multiple vision and vision-language tasks. Experimental results show that VL-MFER performs well in all performance metrics of downstream tasks, and VL-MFER leads to enhancements in transparency compared to other methods, while improving computational efficiency and reducing inference time by up to 13&#x0025;.

Although a few methods consider multiple attributes, they either require additional constraints or prediction heads, incurring high computational overhead or jeopardizing the stability of the training process. More critically, they consider per-attribute protection approaches, raising concerns about fairness gerrymandering where certain attribute combinations remain unfair. This work aims to construct a neutral domain containing fused information across all subgroups and attributes. It delivers fair predictions as the fused input contains neutralized information for all considered attributes. Specifically, we adopt mixup operations to generate samples with fused information. However, our experiments reveal that directly adopting the operations leads to degraded prediction results. The excessive mixup operations result in unrecognizable training data. To this end, we design three distinct mixup schemes that balance information fusion across attributes while retaining distinct visual features critical for training valid models. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and up to eight sensitive attributes demonstrate that the proposed MultiFair method can deliver fairness protections for multiple attributes while maintaining valid prediction results.

Sketch quantity during this early stage of design has been linked with eventual design outcomes and sketch quality has been linked with design perceptions. As such, both are important metrics to track. Prior work has also found gender differences in some of these sketch attributes, and considering gender imbalances in the field, it is important to assess whether there are differences in performance by gender during concept generation and if the use of digital tools exacerbate or mitigate any of these potential differences in performance by gender. Given the increase in use of digital tablets for sketching, it is important to assess how tablet use affects early stage engineering design sketches. This is especially important as tablets can automatically smooth lines and help perfect sketch features, but these features may also take longer to use and may result in fewer sketches produced. This study investigates differences in sketch quality, quantity, and understandability (the effectiveness of the sketch as a communication tool) between sketching on a tablet and sketching with pen on paper during an engineering design concept generation exercise. Results indicate that there is no difference in sketch quantity or understandability between the two tools. However, sketch quality, smoothness, and proportion/accuracy are all higher for the pen and paper condition than for the tablet condition. Finally, no gender differences in performance for either sketch quantity or quality were found. © 2024 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Some of the debates are ongoing, with several people getting more used to this tool and some losing touch with several ethical concerns. Thus, it is crucial to explore the early professional’s perspectives surrounding ChatGPT to comprehend its potential impact on the educational sector and, in particular, society in general. This research aims to address this knowledge gap by employing data mining techniques on LinkedIn to analyze ChatGPT-related discussions and provide a comprehensive textual examination. The dataset for this investigation consists of 166 records written in English by LinkedIn users discussing ChatGPT in its early stage. The study utilized VOSviewer software to clean, analyze, mine, and visualize the data. Among the sample, it was observed that 49% of the users are PhD holders, predominantly with experience in scientific research and data science fields. Hence, the findings reveal that issues such as plagiarism, references, citations, manuscripts, papers, and literature reviews stand out as the major concerns. These results suggest that while ChatGPT can contribute to academic progress by fostering new knowledge, thoughts, and ideas, it can also facilitate academic misconduct, including plagiarism and inaccurate information dissemination. Therefore, this paper also provides discussions on the implications and ethical issues of ChatGPT. In particular, it is imperative to establish clear ethical boundaries and guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs in academic settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.","Academic; ChatGPT; Ethics; LinkedIn; LLMs; Text analysis; Visualization; VOSviewer","","Springer","","","","","","2662995X","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188962177"

In particular, for knowledge-intensive processes, notations that allow flexible orchestration of activities are crucial for supporting discretionary work. Declarative Process Modeling notations allow describing the interplay between the process activities with constraints that need to be met, without specifying how to meet them. Despite being well-suited for modeling flexible processes, declarative notations are not as widely adopted as imperative notations where the process is usually depicted using a flow-based approach. This paper focuses on investigating the semantic transparency of declarative notations, specifically how the visual representation of constraints aligns with the underlying formal concepts used in Declarative Process Models (DPMs). The study concentrates on Dynamic Condition Response (DCR) Graphs, a representative notation of DPMs extensively used in industry and academia. The research employs semi-structured interviews with experts in DCR Graphs, as well as an analysis of semantic transparency based on theoretical models of understandability. The findings indicate that generally colors contribute to the understanding of relations in DPMs, while the shapes used to describe constraints do not accurately convey their semantics. Based on these results, the study proposes an alternative representation of constraints, paving the road for an enhanced representation of DPMs. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","DCR Graphs; Human-centric Information Systems; Human-Computer Interaction; Knowledge-Intensive Processes; Visualization","Graphic methods; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Process engineering; Transparency; Declarative process models; Dynamic condition; Dynamic condition response graph; Human-centric information; Human-centric information system; Knowledge intensive process; Modeling notation; Process-models; Response graphs; Semantic transparencies; Semantics","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","29th International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems, CoopIS 2023","30 October 2023 through 3 November 2023","Groningen","303459","03029743","978-303146845-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175958372"

Although automatically filtering unmanageably large item sets down to a few recommendations often produces results that match the user's interests well, it also prevents users from understanding and exploring items in their larger context. This may reduce users’ perception of transparency and controllability of the system. Visualizations have been proposed as a means for overcoming this problem, with some visualizations providing a complete overview of the entire space of available items. However, thus far item space visualizations have rarely been investigated and compared in user studies. To address this, we developed and empirically compared three applications that present the user with personalized music recommendations embedded in a visualization of the entire item space. The three applications display the same item space as a list, as a treemap, and as a map, respectively. We compared these applications in an online user study and found, against our expectations, that they did not differ much in how the recommendations are perceived. Perception of transparency, recommendation quality, and degree of control over the recommendations received relatively high scores over all three applications. However, we did find a difference in hedonic user experience and perceived novelty of the recommendations. Both factors were perceived to be higher in the map condition. Backed up by a mediation analysis, we argue that a halo effect is the reason for the observed perceived novelty: participants transferred the novelty of the application to the novelty of the recommendations. © 2022","Empirical user studies; Information visualization; Maps; Recommender systems; Treemaps; User experience","Decision making; Information systems; Quality control; Transparency; Visualization; Comparatives studies; Decision-making process; Empirical user study; Information visualization; Itemset; Set-down; Space visualization; Treemap; User study; Users' experiences; Recommender systems","Academic Press","","","","","","10715819","","IHSTE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146051869"

This article proposes an adversarial algorithm unrolling network (AAU-Net) for interpretable mechanical anomaly detection. AAU-Net is a generative adversarial network (GAN). Its generator, composed of an encoder and a decoder, is mainly produced by algorithm unrolling of a sparse coding model, which is specially designed for feature encoding and decoding of vibration signals. Thus, AAU-Net has a mechanism-driven and interpretable network architecture. In other words, it is ad hoc interpretable. Moreover, a multiscale feature visualization approach for AAU-Net is introduced to verify that meaningful features are encoded by AAU-Net, helping users to trust the detection results. The feature visualization approach enables the results of AAU-Net to be interpretable, i.e., post hoc interpretable. To verify AAU-Net's capability of feature encoding and anomaly detection, we designed and performed simulations and experiments.

It is challenging for people to realize the occurrence of AI ethical issues in most cases. The lower the public awareness, the more difficult it is to address AI ethical issues. Many previous studies have explored public reactions and opinions on AI ethical issues through questionnaires and social media platforms like Twitter. However, these approaches primarily focus on categorizing popular topics and sentiments, overlooking the public’s potential lack of knowledge underlying these issues. Few studies revealed the holistic knowledge structure of AI ethical topics and the relations among the subtopics. As the world’s largest online encyclopedia, Wikipedia encourages people to jointly contribute and share their knowledge by adding new topics and following a well-accepted hierarchical structure. Through public viewing and editing, Wikipedia serves as a proxy for knowledge transmission. This study aims to analyze how the public comprehend the body of knowledge of AI ethics. We adopted the community detection approach to identify the hierarchical community of the AI ethical topics, and further extracted the AI ethics-related entities, which are proper nouns, organizations, and persons. The findings reveal that the primary topics at the top-level community, most pertinent to AI ethics, predominantly revolve around knowledge-based and ethical issues. Examples include transitions from Information Theory to Internet Copyright Infringement. In summary, this study contributes to three points, (1) to present the holistic knowledge structure of AI ethics, (2) to evaluate and improve the existing body of knowledge of AI ethics, (3) to enhance public perception of AI ethics to mitigate the risks associated with AI technologies. © The Author(s) 2024.","AI ethics; Community detection; Knowledge structure; Public perception; Visualization; Wikipedia data","Copyrights; Data visualization; Information theory; Knowledge based systems; Philosophical aspects; Population dynamics; Semantics; Social networking (online); Artificial intelligence ethic; Artificial intelligence technologies; Body of knowledge; Community detection; Ethical issues; Knowledge structures; Public awareness; Public perception; Wikipedia; Wikipedia data; Risk perception","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21931127","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188731429"

The existing low-resolution forecast data may not accurately capture the fine-grained temperature patterns required for localized predictions. These forecasts may contain biases that need to be corrected for accurate results. Therefore, there is a need for an effective framework that can downscale low-resolution forecast data and correct biases to generate high-resolution temperature forecasts. The paper proposes a machine learning-based spatial downscaling and bias-correction framework for high-resolution temperature forecasting. The framework utilizes low-resolution forecast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and real-time 1km analysis product data from the National Meteorological Administration, to generate high-resolution 1km forecast temperature data. The framework consists of four modules: data acquisition module, data preprocessing module, downscaling and correction model module, and post-processing and visualization module. Through experiments, it demonstrated that the framework has superior performance and potential in meteorological data downscaling and correction and can be used to achieve real-time high-resolution temperature forecasting, which has important significance for various applications such as climate impact assessment, hydrological modeling, and localized weather forecasting. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Bias correction; Channel attention; Machine learning; Spatial downscaling; Temperature forecasting","Climate models; Data acquisition; Data visualization; Hydrology; Machine learning; Meteorology; Bias correction; Channel attention; Climate impact assessment; Down-scaling; High resolution; Localised; Lower resolution; Machine-learning; Spatial downscaling; Temperature forecasting; Weather forecasting","Springer","","","","","","0924669X","","APITE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197180382"

We can find that the output and input of CNN with an appropriate prior over the weights and biases is a Gaussian process (GP). For the CNN, it is a signal Gaussian model. So, we can use single Gaussian model to explain the computational process of CNN. We show the GP distribution and computational process over the weights and biases.

While transparent machine learning models have been proposed for classification and regression, time series forecasting presents some unique challenges for ensuring transparency. In particular, currently used bottom-up approaches that focus on the values of the time series at specific time points (usually regularly spaced) do not provide a holistic understanding of the entire time series. This limits the applicability of ML in many critical areas. To open up these domains for ML, we propose a top-down framework of bi-level transparency, which involves understanding the higher-level trends and the lower-level properties of the predicted time series. Applying this framework, we develop TIMEVIEW, a transparent ML model for time series forecasting based on static features, complemented with an interactive visualization tool. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and interpretability of our approach, paving the way for more transparent and reliable applications of ML in various domains. © 2024 12th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2024.

It often has poor retrieval performance under modality gap. One way to alleviate such the modality discrepancy is to learn shared person features that are generalizable across different modalities. However, because of significant differences in color between the visible and infrared images, the learned share features are always inclined to specific information of corresponding modality. To this end, we propose a modality bias calibration network (MBCNet) that filters out identity-irrelevant interference and recalibrates the learned modality-shared features. Specifically, to emphasize the modality-shared cues, we employ a feature decomposition module in the feature-level to filter out style variations and extract identity-relevant discriminative cues from the residual feature. In order to achieve a better disentanglement, a dual ranking entropy constraint is further proposed to ensure that the learned features contain only identity-relevant information and discard style-relevant information. Simultaneously, we design a decorrelated orthogonality Loss to ensure the disentangled features are not correlated with each other. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate thatMBCNet significantly improves the cross-modality retrieval performance in social surveillance systems and effectively addresses the modality bias training issue.

In this work, we focus on this question through a study of saliency-based explanations over textual data. Feature-attribution explanations of text models aim to communicate which parts of the input text were more influential than others towards the model decision. Many current explanation methods, such as gradient-based or Shapley value-based methods, provide measures of importance which are well-understood mathematically. But how does a person receiving the explanation (the explainee) comprehend it? And does their understanding match what the explanation attempted to communicate? We empirically investigate the effect of various factors of the input, the feature-attribution explanation, and visualization procedure, on laypeople's interpretation of the explanation. We query crowdworkers for their interpretation on tasks in English and German, and fit a GAMM model to their responses considering the factors of interest. We find that people often mis-interpret the explanations: superficial and unrelated factors, such as word length, influence the explainees' importance assignment despite the explanation communicating importance directly. We then show that some of this distortion can be attenuated: we propose a method to adjust saliencies based on model estimates of over- and under-perception, and explore bar charts as an alternative to heatmap saliency visualization. We find that both approaches can attenuate the distorting effect of specific factors, leading to better-calibrated understanding of the explanation. © 2022 ACM.","cognitive bias; explainability; feature attribution; generalized additive mixed model; human; interpretability; perception; saliency; text","Cognitive bias; Explainability; Feature attribution; Generalized additive mixed model; Generalized additives; Human; Interpretability; Mixed modeling; Saliency; Text; Visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","","5th ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, FAccT 2022","21 June 2022 through 24 June 2022","Virtual, Online","180210","","978-145039352-2","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132880185"

They can be used to identify important features contributing to the network decisions, investigate biases in datasets, and find weaknesses in the system's structure (e.g., network architectures). Lawmakers and regulators may not allow the use of smart systems if these systems cannot explain the logic underlying a decision or action taken. These systems are required to offer a high level of 'transparency' to be approved for deployment. Model transparency is vital for safety–critical applications such as autonomous navigation and operation systems (e.g., autonomous trains or cars), where prediction errors may have serious implications. Thus, being highly accurate without explaining the basis of their performance is not enough to satisfy regulatory requirements. The lack of system interpretability is a major obstacle to the wider adoption of AI in safety–critical applications. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques applied to intelligent systems to justify their decisions offers a possible solution. In this review, we present state-of-the-art explanation techniques in detail. We focus our presentation and critical discussion on visualisation methods for the most adopted architecture in use, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), applied to the domain of image classification. Further, we discuss the evaluation techniques for different explanation methods, which shows that some of the most visually appealing methods are unreliable and can be considered a simple feature or edge detector. In contrast, robust methods can give insights into the model behaviour, which helps to enhance the model performance and boost the confidence in the model's predictions. Besides, the applications of XAI techniques show their importance in many fields such as medicine and industry. We hope that this review proves a valuable contribution for researchers in the field of XAI. © 2022 The Authors","Activation heatmaps; Architecture understanding; Black-box representations; CNN visualisation; Convolutional neural networks; Explainable AI; Feature visualisation; Interpretable neural networks; Saliency maps; XAI","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Intelligent systems; Network architecture; Transparency; Activation heatmap; Architecture understanding; Black box representation; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network visualization; Explainable artificial intelligence; Feature visualization; Heatmaps; Interpretable neural network; Network visualization; Neural-networks; Saliency map; XAI; Visualization","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","01419382","","DISPD","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134035989"

Random forest is an ensemble of bootstrapped independent decision trees that are trained on subsets of input data to make predictions. Although random forest is a robust model that can overcome bias, its inherent complexity, and poor interpretability can make it challenging to apply in many application domains that require transparency and explainability in the model's predictions. This lack of transparency in the decision-making process can prevent users from analyzing what makes the model arrive at a specific prediction. The paper presents a visual analytic application to overcome transparency challenges by providing a clear structure of individual decision trees and hierarchical relationships between features. This allows users to analyze latent information and instils trust in the random forest model. Additionally, statistical analysis of feature ranking agreement and prediction popularity reduces mental burden of the user. The paper includes two case studies to evaluate model's uncertainty, bias, and variances in predictions with explainability at local and global scales of decision paths. The visual analytics application provides a coordinated multiple-view system to instil trust in random forest models. © 2023 IEEE.","Interpretable machine learning; Random forest visualization; Visual analytic; XAI(Explainable AI)","Decision trees; Forecasting; Machine learning; Visualization; Forest visualization; Interpretability; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Model prediction; Random forest modeling; Random forest visualization; Random forests; Visual analytics; XAI(explainable AI); Transparency","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Advancing Technology for Humanity; IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","10th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, DSAA 2023","9 October 2023 through 12 October 2023","Thessaloniki","194312","","979-835034503-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178994740"

Therefore, the rapid and accurate identification and calibration of biases is crucial for NWP in weather forecasting. Conventional approaches, such as various analog post-processing forecast methods, have been designed to aid in bias calibration. However, these approaches fail to consider the spatiotemporal correlations of forecast bias, which can considerably affect calibration efficacy. In this article, we propose a novel bias pattern extraction approach based on forecasting-observation probability density by merging historical forecasting and observation datasets. Given a spatiotemporal scope, our approach extracts and fuses bias patterns and automatically divides regions with similar bias patterns. Termed BicaVis, our spatiotemporal bias pattern visual analytics system is proposed to assist experts in drafting calibration curves on the basis of these bias patterns. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct two case studies with real-world reanalysis datasets. The feedback collected from domain experts confirms the efficacy of our approach.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","calibration; pattern extraction; visual analytics; Weather forecast","Extraction; Visualization; Weather forecasting; Analytic approach; Atmospheric systems; Chaotics; Conventional approach; Density-based; Forecast bias; Numerical weather prediction; Pattern extraction; Probability densities; Visual analytics; article; calibration; extraction; forecasting; human; probability; Calibration","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125550905"

A framework is proposed that integrates transparency, visualisation, and personalisation to create an enhanced restaurant experience for customers. The AR part is built on Unity with the incorporation of the Vuforia Engine Software Development Kit and a mockup version of a digital restaurant menu is created on Figma. Furthermore, a mockup chatbot is integrated in the application to aid customers with personalised dietary restriction information. To conclude, this paper offers an AR-based solution to the problem of food waste via over-ordering.

We encountered this need while being embedded in an academic consortium of four epistemologically-distant scientific teams, who wanted to develop new interdisciplinary hypotheses from their merged datasets. By inviting these scientists to collaboratively develop visualisation prototypes of their data within their own and then towards the other disciplines, we uncovered four data frictions that relate to discipline-specific interpretations of data, methodological approaches, ways of handling data uncertainties, as well as the large differences in dataset scale and granularity. We then recognised how the resulting visualisation prototypes contained several promising techniques that addressed these frictions transparently, such as retaining their overall visualisation context and using visual translators to mediate between differing scales. Driven by critical data discourse that calls for frictions to be foregrounded rather than be occluded, we generalised these techniques into a series of actionable design considerations. While originating from a single case of an interdisciplinary collaboration, we believe that our findings form a crucial step towards enabling a more transparent and accountable interdisciplinary data visualisation practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Critical data visualisation; Data friction; Design activities; Interdisciplinary collaboration; Visualisation for collaboration; Visualisation transparency","Data handling; Data visualization; Large dataset; Visualization; Critical data; Critical data visualization; Data friction; Data uncertainty; Design activity; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Interpretation of data; Methodological approach; Visualization for collaboration; Visualization transparency; Friction","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","09259724","","CSCWE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134664163"

We provide an open source web-based visualization tool and offer hands-on experience in exploring the effects of these debiasing techniques on the geometry of high-dimensional word vectors. To help understand how various debiasing techniques change the underlying geometry, we decompose each technique into modular and interpretable sequences of primitive operations, and study their effect on the word vectors using dimensionality reduction and interactive visual exploration.

To understand the kind of biases writers are concerned about and how they mitigate those in their writing, we conducted formative interviews with nine writers. The interviews suggested that despite a writer's best interest, tracking and managing implicit biases such as a lack of agency, supporting or submissive roles, or harmful language for characters representing marginalized groups is challenging as the story becomes longer and complicated. Based on the interviews, we developed DramatVis Personae (DVP), a visual analytics tool that allows writers to assign social identities to characters, and evaluate how characters and different intersectional social identities are represented in the story. To evaluate DVP, we first conducted think-aloud sessions with three writers and found that DVP is easy-to-use, naturally integrates into the writing process, and could potentially help writers in several critical bias identification tasks. We then conducted a follow-up user study with 11 writers and found that participants could answer questions related to bias detection more efficiently using DVP in comparison to a simple text editor.  © 2022 ACM.","and NLP.; bias; Creative writing; visualization","File editors; Human engineering; Analytic tools; And NLP.; Bias; Children books; Creative writings; Social identity; Text analytics; Think aloud; Visual analytics; Writing process; Visualization","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Deakin University; Monash University; SIGCHI","2022 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference: Digital Wellbeing, DIS 2022","13 June 2022 through 17 June 2022","Virtual, Online","180111","","978-145039358-4","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133580709"

Existing bias audit tools usually just offer standard group fairness metrics, which leads to strong restrictions: neither one is morally appropriate in all contexts, and there are contexts in which none of them is morally appropriate. Building on new findings from computer science and philosophy, the FairnessLab provides a much wider range of metrics, and guides users to generate a fairness measure that is morally appropriate for a given context. Thus, the FairnessLab can be used to define context-specific fairness metrics that are sensitive to the consequences experienced by affected individuals [1, 2]. Furthermore, it includes techniques to mitigate unfairness w.r.t. a specified metric. This empowers data scientists and developers to (i) make their moral choices explicit, (ii) derive appropriate fairness metrics that are sensitive to consequences experienced by the individuals affected by the decisions, (iii) navigate the emerging tradeoffs (e.g., between efficiency and fairness of the outcomes).

Indeed, any misinterpretation or flaw in the outputs of Data Analytics results can cause significant damage, specialy when dealing with one of the most often overlooked issues, namely the unaware use of biased data. When data bias goes unadverted, it warps the meaning of data, having a devastating effect on Data Analytics results. Although it is widely argued that the most common manner to deal with data bias is to rebalance biased datasets, it is not an aseptic transformation, leading to several potentially undesired side-effects that will probably harm the result of data analyses. Therefore, in order to analyze the underlying bias in datasets, in this work we present (i) a comprehensive methodology based on visualization techniques, which assists users in the definition of their analytical requirements to detect and visually represent the data bias automatically helping them to find out whether it is appropriate to artificially rebalance their dataset or not; (ii) a novel metamodel for visually representing bias; (iii) a motivating real-world running example used to analyze the impact of bias in Data Analytics and (iv) an assessment of the improvements introduced by our proposal through a complete real-world case study by using a Fire Department Calls for Service dataset, thus demonstrating that rebalancing datasets is not always the best option. It is crucial to study the context where the decisions are going to be taken. Moreover, it is also important to do a pre-analysis with the aim of knowing the nature of the datasets and how biased they are.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; Data analytics; data bias; data visualization; model-driven development; requirements engineering","Data visualization; Metadata; Requirements engineering; Business Process; Daily lives; Data analytics; Data bias; Model-driven-development; Proposal; Real-world; Rebalancing; Requirement engineering; Training data; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161067289"

Drawing from 18 selected studies, the results illuminate a complex interplay of tools, methods, and approaches, notably the prominence of VR engines like Unreal Engine and Unity. However, despite these tools, a universal solution for effective AI visualization remains elusive, reflecting the unique strengths and limitations of each technique. The application of VR for AI visualization across multiple domains is observed, despite challenges such as high data complexity and cognitive load. Moreover, it briefly discusses the emerging ethical considerations pertaining to the broad integration of these technologies. Despite these challenges, the field shows significant potential, emphasizing the need for dedicated research efforts to unlock the full potential of these immersive technologies.

Research on transparency should aid the audience in making informed decisions. Few have, however, created clear and compelling visual representations of transparency requirements (stakeholders, data, process, policy, and their relationships) utilizing current information visualization and visual analytics methodologies. Maintaining both the quality and visual representation of transparency requirements is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we propose TranspVis, a new visual analytics tool designed for transparency analytics. It consists of multiple views that aid domain experts in efficiently analyzing, updating, and saving application transparency datasets. TranspVis is an interactive tool for displaying TranspLan (i.e., Transparency Language) representations manually generated by experts utilizing the Shield, Infolet, and SitReq forms. In addition to the new circle view, TranspVis generates and synchronizes these latter representations automatically. TranspVis is evaluated using AWS and WhatsApp policy datasets as two case studies. Results show that TranspVis extends the initial TranspLan representation and significantly improves transparency requirement analytics in terms of visual encoding, interactions, and insight extraction. © 2022 by the authors.","data science; information visualization; transparency analytics; TranspLan modeling language; visual analytics","","MDPI","","","","","","20763417","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143680325"

However, no work has empirically tested how multiple forecast visualization choices impact trust and task-based performance. The three studies presented in this paper ($N=1299$) examine how visualization choices impact trust in COVID-19 mortality forecasts and how they influence performance in a trend prediction task. These studies focus on line charts populated with real-time COVID-19 data that varied the number and color encoding of the forecasts and the presence of best/worst-case forecasts. The studies reveal that trust in COVID-19 forecast visualizations initially increases with the number of forecasts and then plateaus after 6-9 forecasts. However, participants were most trusting of visualizations that showed less visual information, including a 95% confidence interval, single forecast, and grayscale encoded forecasts. Participants maintained high trust in intervals labeled with 50% and 25% and did not proportionally scale their trust to the indicated interval size. Despite the high trust, the 95% CI condition was the most likely to evoke predictions that did not correspond with the actual COVID-19 trend. Qualitative analysis of participants' strategies confirmed that many participants trusted both the simplistic visualizations and those with numerous forecasts. This work provides practical guides for how COVID-19 forecast visualizations influence trust, including recommendations for identifying the range where forecasts balance trade-offs between trust and task-based performance.  © 2022 IEEE.","COVID-19; line charts; multiple forecast visualizations; time-series data; uncertainty visualization","Computer Graphics; COVID-19; Forecasting; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Trust; Commerce; Data visualization; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Time series analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Line chart; Multiple forecast visualization; Pandemic; Performance; Predictive models; Task analysis; Time-series data; Trade off; Uncertainty; Uncertainty visualization; computer graphics; forecasting; human; trust; COVID-19","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139485826"

Industry experts have participated in thorough discussions on the challenges associated with operationalising fairness in the development of machine learning-empowered solutions, in which a shift toward human-centred approaches is promptly dvocated to mitigate the limitations of existing techniques. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop approach for fairness auditing, presenting a mixed visual analytical system (hereafter referred to as &#x2018;FairCompass&#x2019;), which integrates both subgroup discovery technique and the decision tree-based schema for end users.

The workshop on Transparency and Explanations in Smart Systems (TExSS) welcomes researchers and practitioners interested in exchanging ideas for overcoming the design, development, and evaluation issues in intelligent user interfaces. Specifically, we will focus on barriers preventing better reliability, trainability, usability, trustworthiness, fairness, accountability, and transparency.

To alleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that embodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social biases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent causal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to inject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a group, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair causal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness metrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by refining the causal model and acting on the unfair causal edges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the system uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the current causal model while ensuring a minimal change from the original dataset. Users can visually assess the impact of their interactions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion, and the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the debiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer predictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and also a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly compared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics while incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover, our human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated approach on trust, interpretability and accountability.  © 2022 IEEE.","Algorithmic Fairness; Causality; Debiasing; Human-in-the-loop; Visual Analytics","Algorithms; Bias; Causality; Computer Graphics; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Data visualization; Domain Knowledge; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Causal modeling; Causality; De-biasing; Human-in-the-loop; Interpretability; Machine learning algorithms; Visual analytics; algorithm; causality; computer graphics; female; human; machine learning; statistical bias; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139491358"

However, we know very little about how chart designs might influence readers' perceptions of the people behind the data. Specifically, could designs interact with readers' social cognitive biases in ways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes? For example, when analyzing social inequality, bar charts are a popular choice to present outcome disparities between race, gender, or other groups. But bar charts may encourage deficit thinking, the perception that outcome disparities are caused by groups' personal strengths or deficiencies, rather than external factors. These faulty personal attributions can then reinforce stereotypes about the groups being visualized. We conducted four experiments examining design choices that influence attribution biases (and therefore deficit thinking). Crowdworkers viewed visualizations depicting social outcomes that either mask variability in data, such as bar charts or dot plots, or emphasize variability in data, such as jitter plots or prediction intervals. They reported their agreement with both personal and external explanations for the visualized disparities. Overall, when participants saw visualizations that hide within-group variability, they agreed more with personal explanations. When they saw visualizations that emphasize within-group variability, they agreed less with personal explanations. These results demonstrate that data visualizations about social inequity can be misinterpreted in harmful ways and lead to stereotyping. Design choices can influence these biases: Hiding variability tends to increase stereotyping while emphasizing variability reduces it.  © 2022 IEEE.","Correspondence Bias; Deficit Thinking; Diversity; Equity; Fundamental Attribution Error; Storytelling","Computer Graphics; Humans; Social Perception; Stereotyping; Data visualization; Dispersions; Jitter; Visualization; Bar chart; Correspondence bias; Deficit thinking; Diversity; Equity; Fundamental attribution error; Social outcomes; Storytelling; Systematic; Uncertainty; computer graphics; human; perception; stereotyping; NASA","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139864831"

Firstly, the incomplete trust between decision-makers is completed with trust transfer operators and propagation probability in trust propagation process. Secondly, a preference aggregation model based on Weber point is proposed to aggregate the group preference visually. Thirdly, opinions are adjusted to reach a consensus. Finally, the ranking of alternatives is determined by the correlation coefficient with the group preference as a reference. Findings: The Weber point-based model proposed in this study can minimize the gap in the preference of alternatives between the group and all decision-makers, and realize the visualization of aggregation result. A case of plan selection is introduced to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model.

AI-assisted DSS are typically employed to make data-driven recommendations to human decision-makers in an effort to improve efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the AI used to power DSS are typically blackbox in nature, meaning that human decision-makers are unaware of exactly how these systems are coming to their conclusions. This is problematic since research in algorithmic fairness already shows that data-driven AI systems can be influenced by social biases present in training data, to reinforce systemic biases and perpetuate unfairness towards minority social groups. When used in high-stakes decision-making, such systems risk protracting systemic biases and further driving social division. An area of research is emerging acknowledging that unfairness can leak through 'proxy' features, causing an implicit-bias effect. In this work-in-progress paper, we propose explaining fairness properties of AI systems and their downstream social impacts to decision-makers - by visualising bias-leakage through proxies - for improved fairness. Finally, we are currently in the process of conducting a study to empirically assess how visualising proxy-biases in AI-assisted DSS can affect decision-making and improve fairness. © AISB Convention 2023.All rights reserved.","bias-leakage; bias-visualisation; decision support system; downstream unfairness; fairness; machine learning; machine-bias; proxy","Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Learning systems; Machine learning; Bias-leakage; Bias-visualization; Decision makers; Decisions makings; Down-stream; Downstream unfairness; Fairness; Machine-bias; Machine-learning; Proxy; Decision making","The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour","","2023 Convention of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour, AISB 2023","13 April 2023 through 14 April 2023","Swansea","193654","","978-171387946-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176361293"

In this paper, we study the human factors aspect of the human-swarm interaction and investigate how having access to high-quality data can affect the performance of the human-swarm system - the number of tasks completed and the human trust level in operation. We designed an experiment where a human operator is tasked to operate a swarm to identify casualties in an area within a given time period. One group of operators had the option to request high-quality pictures while the other group had to base their decision on the available low-quality images. We performed a user study with 120 participants and recorded their success rate (directly logged via the simulation platform) as well as their workload and trust level (measured through a questionnaire after completing a human-swarm scenario). The findings from our study indicated that the group granted access to high-quality data exhibited an increased workload and placed greater trust in the swarm, thus confirming our initial hypothesis.

Grounded in the Extended Parallel Process Model, we analyzed how perceptions of conservation responsibility and the visualization of pollution affected perceived water quality threats, efficacy, and pro-environmental behavior outcomes. We conducted a 2 × 2 between-subjects controlled message-testing experiment with 502 adults from the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Individuals viewed personal or government attribution messages with fear or non-fear visuals to see how messages affected intentions to take part in a river clean-up day, enact environmentally friendly behaviors, and comment on public policy. Messages that promoted government responsibility and those that featured images of polluted water increased response efficacy, threat appraisals, fear, and intentions. Promoting personal responsibility yielded more limited effects. Furthermore, messages were less effective when they featured visuals of clean water. Implications include recommendations for using responsibility attribution messages in practice and engaging the public with information about unseen hazards. © 2022 by the authors.","attribution of responsibility; community engagement; extended parallel process model; pro-environmental behaviors; water quality","Chesapeake Bay; United States; cleanup; experimental study; governance approach; local participation; perception; visualization; water quality","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140638181"

Doubts concerning ethical, legal, and social implications of such AIAs consequently become increasingly compelling. Our society now finds itself confronted with decisive questions: Should we trust AI? Is it fair, transparent, and respecting privacy? An individual psychological threshold for cooperation with AIAs has been postulated. In Shaefer's words: “No trust, no use”.

Many applications can benefit from the incorporation of collectives, including environmental monitoring, disaster response missions, and infrastructure support. Transparency research has primarily focused on how the design of the models, visualizations, and control mechanisms influence human-collective interactions. Traditionally most transparency research has evaluated one system design element. This article analyzed two models and visualizations to understand how the system design elements impacted human-collective interactions, to quantify which model and visualization combination provided the best transparency, and provide design guidance, based on remote supervision of collectives. The consensus decision-making and baseline models, as well as an individual collective entity and abstract visualizations, were analyzed for sequential best-of-n decision-making tasks involving four collectives, composed of 200 entities each. Both models and visualizations provided transparency and influenced human-collective interactions differently.

Over the last decade, several laboratory studies have been conducted to investigate these phenomena, but, due to the opacity of soil, the typical experimental observations of cyclic liquefaction have been limited to post-test observations of fine movement and the data of water pressures and soil settlements. In this paper, we show how partially transparent soil models can be used to provide the visualization of a moving saturation front and that fully transparent models can be used to observe fine migration during the cycling loading of a soil column. The changing saturation degree was tracked using a correlation between the degree of saturation, soil transparency, and grayscale image values, while particle movements of fines and larger particles were measured using a small number of fluorescent particles and particle tracking velocimetry. Another innovation of the work was in using mixtures of ethyl benzoate and ethanol as a low-viscosity pore fluid with the refractive index matching the fused silica soil particles. The benefits and challenges of these visualization tests are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.","cyclic liquefaction; fines migration; mud pumping; soil liquefaction; transparent soils; wetting front","Fused silica; Pore fluids; Refractive index; Soil liquefaction; Supersaturation; Visualization; Cyclic liquefaction; Fines migration; Heavy haul; Laboratory studies; Mud-pumping; Post test; Soil settlements; Transparent soils; Water pressures; Wetting fronts; Soils","MDPI","","","","","","2313433X","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138493398"

Nevertheless, for specific remote sensing image scene classification tasks, obtaining diverse and large amounts of data remains a daunting challenge, leading to limitations in the applicability of trained models. Consequently, researchers are increasingly focusing on optimal data utilization and interpretability of learning. Drawing inspiration from brain neural perception research, researchers have proposed novel approaches for deeper interpretation and optimization of deep learning models from diverse perspectives. In this paper, we present a brain-inspired network optimization model for remote sensing image scene classification, which considers both shape and texture features and reconstructs feature scaling of data through feature bias estimation. The model achieves greater robustness through complementary training. We evaluate our optimized model on general datasets by integrating it into an existing benchmark method and compare its performance with the original approach. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model is highly effective, with dynamically reconstructed data leading to a significant enhancement of model learning.  © 2013 IEEE.","brain-inspired learning; data enhancement; feature bias; Remote sensing image; scene classification","Benchmarking; Brain; Classification (of information); Data visualization; Deep learning; Image analysis; Image classification; Image enhancement; Semantics; Adaptation models; Bio-inspired computing; Brain modeling; Brain-inspired; Brain-inspired learning; Data enhancement; Feature bias; Image-analysis; Remote sensing images; Remote-sensing; Scene classification; Remote sensing","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153406846"

Visual analytics is essential for data analytics for e.g., presenting the data to provide an instinctive perception in exploratory data analysis, facilitating the presentation of data analysis results and the subsequent discussion on that. Visual analytics should allow a transparent common ground for discussion between experts in data analysis projects, given the multidisciplinary background of these experts. However, a standarised and formalised way of describing the knowledge and practice of visualisation is still lacking in the industry, which hamstrings the transparency and reusability of visual analytics. A visualisation ontology which models the nature and procedure of visualisation is well-suited to provide such standardisation. Currently a few studies discuss partially the modelling of visualisation, but insufficiently study the procedure of visualisation tasks, which is important for transparency and reusability especially in an industrial scenario.

However, there is a lack of consensus on what constitutes transparency across domains of research, not to mention transparency guidelines for designers and marketers. In this review, we explored the question of what transparency means in current research and practices by reviewing the literature in three domains: persuasive technology, immersive technology and online marketing. Literature reviewed, including both empirical research and position articles, covered multidisciplinary areas including computer science and information technology, psychology, healthcare, human computer interaction, business and management, law and public health. In this paper, we summarized our findings through a framework of transparency and provided insights into the different aspects of transparency, categorized into ten themes (i.e., Organizational Transparency, Information Transparency, Transparency of System Design, Data Privacy and Informed Consent, Transparency of Online Advertising, Potential Risks, User Autonomy, Informed Decision Making, Information Visualization, Personalization and User-centered design) along three dimensions (i.e., Types of transparency, Impact on User and Potential Solutions). Addressing aspects of transparency will facilitate users’ autonomy and contribute to their informed decision making. © 2022 The Authors","Immersive technology; Impact on user; Informed decision making; Online marketing; Persuasive technology; transparency","Data privacy; Data visualization; Electronic commerce; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Information use; Marketing; Transparency; User centered design; 'current; Decisions makings; Immersive technologies; Impact on user; Informed decision; Informed decision making; Online marketing; Persuasive technology; Technology marketings; User autonomy; Decision making","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","07475632","","CHBEE","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140980364"

Written records often reflect bias, and once bias is identified; it is possible to refer individuals for training to reduce bias. Many machine learning tools exist to explore text data and create predictive models that can search written records to identify real-time bias. However, few previous studies investigate large language model embeddings and geometric models of biased text data to understand geometry's impact on bias modeling accuracy. To overcome this issue, this study utilizes the RedditBias database to analyze textual biases. Four transformer models, including BERT and RoBERTa variants, were explored. Post-embedding, t-SNE allowed two-dimensional visualization of data. KNN classifiers differentiated bias types, with lower k-values proving more effective. Findings suggest BERT, particularly mini BERT, excels in bias classification, while multilingual models lag. The recommendation emphasizes refining monolingual models and exploring domain-specific biases.  © 2023 IEEE.","Bias; machine learning; Natural language processing; Text Embeddings; Topological data analysis","Data visualization; Machine learning; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Topology; 'current; Bias; Embeddings; Language processing; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Text data; Text embedding; Topological data analysis; Embeddings","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","6th International Conference on Signal Processing and Information Security, ICSPIS 2023","8 November 2023 through 9 November 2023","Dubai","195406","","979-835032959-9","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182268409"

However, these models require an avalanche of expensive human labeled training data and many iterations to train their large number of parameters. This severely limits their scalability to the real-world long-tail distributed categories, some of which are with a large number of instances, but with only a few manually annotated. Learning from such extremely limited labeled examples is known as Few-Shot Learning (FSL). Different to prior arts that leverage meta-learning or data augmentation strategies to alleviate this extremely data-scarce problem, this paper presents a statistical approach, dubbed Instance Credibility Inference (ICI) to exploit the support of unlabeled instances for few-shot visual recognition. Typically, we repurpose the self-taught learning paradigm to predict pseudo-labels of unlabeled instances with an initial classifier trained from the few shot and then select the most confident ones to augment the training set to re-train the classifier. This is achieved by constructing a (Generalized) Linear Model (LM/GLM) with incidental parameters to model the mapping from (un-)labeled features to their (pseudo-)labels, in which the sparsity of the incidental parameters indicates the credibility of the corresponding pseudo-labeled instance. We rank the credibility of pseudo-labeled instances along the regularization path of their corresponding incidental parameters, and the most trustworthy pseudo-labeled examples are preserved as the augmented labeled instances. This process is repeated until all the unlabeled samples are included in the expanded training set. Theoretically, under the conditions of restricted eigenvalue, irrepresentability, and large error, our approach is guaranteed to collect all the correctly-predicted pseudo-labeled instances from the noisy pseudo-labeled set. Extensive experiments under two few-shot settings show the effectiveness of our approach on four widely used few-shot visual recognition benchmark datasets including miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CIFAR-FS, and CUB.

As part of the DIS '22 Doctoral Consortium, I am presenting my PhD research on visualising meaningful transparency for users. We are exploring the role of visualisation as a lever to make system transparency more meaningful to users. We consider transparency from a broad socio-technical and systemic perspective, with HCI and Art History research methods.

It is important to understand how users’ trust is affected by ML models’ suggestions, even when those models are wrong. Many research efforts have focused on the user's ability to interpret what a model has learned. In this paper, we seek to understand another aspect of ML interpretability: whether and how the presence of classification probabilities and their different distributions are related to users’ trust in model outcomes, especially in ambiguous instances. To this end, we conducted two online surveys in which we asked participants to evaluate their agreement with image classifications of pictures of animals made by an ML model. In the first, we analyze their trust before and after presenting them the model classification probabilities. In the second, we investigate the relationships between class probability distributions and users’ trust in the model. We found that, in some cases, the additional information is correlated with undue trust in the model's classifications. However, in others, they are associated with inappropriate skepticism. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data visualization; Human-centered AI; Human-centered machine learning; Trust","Computer vision; Data visualization; Image classification; Machine learning; Probability distributions; Surveys; Class probabilities; Human-centered AI; Human-centered machine learning; Large-scales; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model classification; Pressung; Trust; Classification (of information)","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","25901184","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137400465"

In this work, we propose a visual saliency prediction model that directly takes 360° video in the equirectangular format.

While analysts often report a single analysis without documenting how it was chosen, this can cause serious transparency and methodological issues. To make the sensitivity of analysis results to analytical choices transparent, some statisticians and methodologists advocate the use of ‘multiverse analysis’: reporting the full range of outcomes that result from all combinations of defensible analytic choices. Summarizing this combinatorial explosion of statistical results presents unique challenges; several approaches to visualizing the output of multiverse analyses have been proposed across a variety of fields (e.g. psychology, statistics, economics, neuroscience). In this article, we (1) introduce a consistent conceptual framework and terminology for multiverse analyses that can be applied across fields; (2) identify the tasks researchers try to accomplish when visualizing multiverse analyses and (3) classify multiverse visualizations into ‘archetypes’, assessing how well each archetype supports each task. Our work sets a foundation for subsequent research on developing visualization tools and techniques to support multiverse analysis and its reporting. © 2022 Eurographics - The European Association for Computer Graphics and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","multiverse analysis; sensibility analysis; statistical graphics; transparent reporting","Computer graphics; Sensitivity analysis; Statistics; Combinatorial explosion; Conceptual frameworks; Multisteps; Multiverse analyse; Sensibility analysis; Statistical graphics; Tools and techniques; Transparent reporting; Visualization technique; Visualization tools; Visualization","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","01677055","","CGFOD","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124472075"

This may be related to the increasing abundance of data that can be harnessed but can hardly be managed manually. Intelligence analysis of communications data in investigative journalism, criminal intelligence, and law present particularly interesting cases, as they must take into account the often highly sensitive properties of the underlying operations and data. At the same time, these are areas where increasingly automated, sophisticated approaches and tailored systems can be particularly useful and relevant, especially in terms of Big Data manageability. However, by the shifting of responsibilities, this also poses dangers. In addition to privacy concerns, these dangers relate to uncertain or poor data quality, leading to discrimination and potentially misleading insights. Other problems relate to a lack of transparency and traceability, making it difficult to accurately identify problems and determine appropriate remedial strategies. Visual analytics combines machine learning methods with interactive visual interfaces to enable human sense- and decision-making. This technique can be key for designing and operating meaningful interactive communication analysis systems that consider these ethical challenges. In this interdisciplinary work, a joint endeavor of computer scientists, ethicists, and scholars in Science & Technology Studies, we investigate and evaluate opportunities and risks involved in using Visual analytics approaches for communication analysis in intelligence applications in particular. We introduce, at first, the common technological systems used in communication analysis, with a special focus on intelligence analysis in criminal investigations, further discussing the domain-specific ethical implications, tensions, and risks involved. We then make the case of how tailored Visual Analytics approaches may reduce and mitigate the described problems, both theoretically and through practical examples. Offering interactive analysis capabilities and what-if explorations while facilitating guidance, provenance generation, and bias awareness (through nudges, for example) can improve analysts' understanding of their data, increasing trustworthiness, accountability, and generating knowledge. We show that finding Visual Analytics design solutions for ethical issues is not a mere optimization task with an ideal final solution. Design solutions for specific ethical problems (e.g., privacy) often trigger new ethical issues (e.g., accountability) in other areas. Balancing out and negotiating these trade-offs has, as we argue, to be an integral aspect of the system design process from the outset. Finally, our work identifies existing gaps and highlights research opportunities, further describing how our results can be transferred to other domains. With this contribution, we aim at informing more ethically-aware approaches to communication analysis in intelligence operations. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Communication Analysis; Critical Algorithm Studies; Critical Data Studies; Ethic Awareness; Intelligence Analysis; Interdisciplinary Research; Machine Learning; Science & Technology Studies; Visual Analytics","Balancing; Crime; Data communication systems; Economic and social effects; Ethical technology; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Visualization; Algorithm study; Communication analysis; Critical algorithm study; Critical data; Critical data study; Ethic awareness; Intelligence analysis; Interdisciplinary research; Machine-learning; Science & technology study; Science technologies; Visual analytics; Decision making","Association for Computing Machinery","","5th ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, FAccT 2022","21 June 2022 through 24 June 2022","Virtual, Online","180210","","978-145039352-2","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132968553"

This hurdle presents a particular challenge in using Neural Networks in safety-critical systems, which require high performance and transparency such as medical diagnosis of life-threatening diseases. This paper seeks to build and test a neural network for grading gliomas of comparable function and complexity to others in the field, then to apply Data Visualisation techniques to render the internal workings of the NN more understandable to a human observer. The purpose is to develop a system that can classify brain tumors into low-grade gliomas (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG), to aid with diagnosis and prognosis The Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge 2020 (BraTS2020) data set was used, with data categorised based on a combination of grade assigned in BraTS2020, and the labels in the segmentation data. As some categories are over-represented, methods were employed to ensure a better balance between different categories. Data augmentation was used to expand the limited number of scans in the BraTS2020. A 3D convolution neural network (CNN) was constructed to grade gliomas. With the method developed in this paper, an accuracy of 94.1% was achieved. A newly devised method to visually represent the weights of a convolution is explored. These graphs, called 'weight graphs' allow convolutions to be condensed into a visual medium. The weight graph is designed for easy visual interpretation of the weights assigned within a particular convolution. To overcome the limitations of weight graphs, an alternate graph was devised, called a balance graph, because it shows the overall balance of weights in a kernel, allowing for a quick impression of what effect a single kernel has. It is demonstrated that Balance Graphs improve the accessibility and transparency of the of the weights in convolution layers.  © 2022 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; Data Visualization; Graphs; Image Processing","Brain; Classification (of information); Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Deep neural networks; Diagnosis; Grading; Image processing; Safety engineering; Transparency; Tumors; Visualization; Black boxes; Brain tumor segmentation; Convolutional neural network; Graph; High transparency; Images processing; Learning neural networks; Neural-networks; Safety critical systems; Visual data; Convolution","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Computer Society; International Association for Computer and Information Science (ACIS)","24th IEEE/ACIS International Winter Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing, SNPD 2022","7 December 2022 through 9 December 2022","Taichung","187103","","979-835031041-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150261093"

Experts who are familiar with their datasets will often make implicit, mental corrections when analyzing a dataset, or will be cautious not to be overly confident about their findings if caveats are present. However, personal knowledge about the caveats of a dataset is typically not incorporated in a structured way, which is problematic if others who lack that knowledge interpret the data. In this work, we define such analysts' knowledge about datasets as data hunches. We differentiate data hunches from uncertainty and discuss types of hunches. We then explore ways of recording data hunches, and, based on a prototypical design, develop recommendations for designing visualizations that support data hunches. We conclude by discussing various challenges associated with data hunches, including the potential for harm and challenges for trust and privacy. We envision that data hunches will empower analysts to externalize their knowledge, facilitate collaboration and communication, and support the ability to learn from others' data hunches.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Data Hunches; Data Visualization; Uncertainty","Data structures; Data visualization; Uncertainty analysis; Blood; Data hunch; Learn+; Recording; Recording data; Uncertainty; article; human; human experiment; privacy; trust; uncertainty; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139528255"

While such algorithmic fairness during model training is worthwhile, we see fit to mitigate human cognitive biases earlier, namely during data entry. We developed a conversational agent with voice-based data entry and visualization to support financial consultations, which are human-human settings with information asymmetries. In a pre-study, we reveal data-entry biases in advisors by a quantitative analysis of 5 advisors consulting 15 clients in total. Our main study evaluates the conversational agent with 12 advisors and 24 clients. A thematic analysis of interviews shows that advisors introduce biases by “feeling” and “forgetting” data. Additionally, the conversational agent makes financial consultations more transparent and automates data entry. These findings may be transferred to various dyads, such as doctor visits. Finally, we stress that AI not only poses a risk of becoming a mirror of human biases but also has the potential to intervene in the early stages of data entry. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cognitive Bias; Conversational Agent; Data Entry; Reliance; Trust","Artificial intelligence; 'current; Algorithmics; Cognitive bias; Conversational agents; Garbage in garbage outs; Human bias; Information asymmetry; Model training; Reliance; Trust; Data visualization","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","19th IFIP TC 13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, INTERACT 2023","28 August 2023 through 1 September 2023","York","299839","03029743","978-303142285-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173050180"

Most current studies assume that the transferable knowledge can be well used to identify novel categories. However, such transferable capability may be impacted by the dataset bias, and this problem has rarely been investigated before. Besides, most of few-shot learning methods are biased to different datasets, which is also an important issue that needs to be investigated deeply. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of transferable capabilities learned from base categories. Specifically, we use the relevance to measure relationships between base categories and novel categories. Distributions of base categories are depicted via the instance density and category diversity. The FSIR model learns better transferable knowledge from relevant training data. In the relevant data, dense instances or diverse categories can further enrich the learned knowledge. Experimental results on different sub-datasets of Imagenet demonstrate category relevance, instance density and category diversity can depict transferable bias from distributions of base categories. Second, we investigate performance differences on different datasets from the aspects of dataset structures and different few-shot learning methods. Specifically, we introduce image complexity, intra-concept visual consistency, and inter-concept visual similarity to quantify characteristics of dataset structures. We use these quantitative characteristics and eight few-shot learning methods to analyze performance differences on multiple datasets. Based on the experimental analysis, some insightful observations are obtained from the perspective of both dataset structures and few-shot learning methods. We hope these observations are useful to guide future few-shot learning research on new datasets or tasks.

The fundamental sensor fusion task of orientation estimation is a prerequisite for most further data processing steps in inertial motion tracking, such as position and velocity estimation, joint angle estimation, and 3D visualization. Errors in the estimated orientations severely affect all further processing steps. Recent systematic comparisons of existing algorithms show that out-of-the-box accuracy is often low and that application-specific tuning is required to obtain high accuracy. In the present work, we propose and extensively evaluate a quaternion-based orientation estimation algorithm that is based on a novel approach of filtering the acceleration measurements in an almost-inertial frame and that includes extensions for gyroscope bias estimation and magnetic disturbance rejection, as well as a variant for offline data processing. In contrast to all existing work, we perform an extensive evaluation, using a large collection of publicly available datasets and eight literature methods for comparison. The proposed method consistently outperforms all eight literature methods and achieves an average RMSE of 2.9°, while the errors obtained with literature methods range from 5.3° to 16.7°. This improved accuracy with respect to the state of the art is observed not only in average but also for each of several different motion characteristics, as well as for gyroscope bias estimation. Since the evaluation was performed with one single fixed parametrization across a very diverse dataset collection, we conclude that the proposed method provides unprecedented out-of-the-box performance for a broad range of motions, sensor hardware, and environmental conditions. This gain in orientation estimation accuracy is expected to advance the field of IMU-based motion analysis and provide performance benefits in numerous applications. The provided open-source implementation makes it easy to employ the proposed method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","AHRS; Attitude estimation; Gyroscope bias estimation; IMU; Inertial measurement unit; Inertial sensor; Magnetic disturbances; Orientation estimation; Sensor fusion","Data handling; Data visualization; Disturbance rejection; Large dataset; Magnetism; Sensor data fusion; Three dimensional computer graphics; AHRS; Attitude estimation; Bias estimation; Gyroscope bias estimation; Inertial measurements units; Inertial sensor; Magnetic disturbance; Orientation estimation; Sensor fusion; Gyroscopes","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","15662535","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140458893"

Novel technologies in automated machine learning (AutoML) ease algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization complexity. AutoML frame-works have achieved notable success in hyperparameter tuning and surpassed the performance of human experts. However, depending on such frameworks as black-box can leave machine learning practitioners without insights into the inner working of the AutoML process and hence influence their trust in the models produced. In addition, excluding humans from the loop creates several limitations. For example, most of the current AutoML frameworks ignore the user preferences on defining or controlling the search space, which consequently can impact the performance of the models produced and the acceptance of these models by the end-users. The research in the area of transparency and controllability of AutoML has attracted much interest lately, both in academia and industry. However, existing tools are usually restricted to supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression, while unsupervised learning, particularly clustering, remains a largely unexplored problem. Motivated by these shortcomings, we design and implement cSmartML-GlassBox, an interactive visualization tool that en-ables users to refine the search space of AutoML and analyze the results. cSmartML-GlassBox is equipped with a recommendation engine to recommend a time budget that is likely adequate for a new dataset to obtain well-performing pipeline. In addition, the tool supports multi-granularity visualization to enable machine learning practitioners to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the explored configurations and refine/control the search space. Furthermore, cSmartML-GlassBox is equipped with a logging mechanism such that repeated runs on the same dataset can be more effective by avoiding evaluating the same previously considered configurations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of the cSmartML-GlassBox through a user evaluation study with 23 participants and an expert-based usability study based on four experts. We find that the proposed tool increases users' understanding and trust in the AutoML frameworks.  © 2022 IEEE.","clustering; hyperparameter optimization; meta-learning","Budget control; Glass; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; User interfaces; Visualization; Automated clustering; Automated machines; Clusterings; Hyper-parameter optimizations; Learning frameworks; Learning process; Machine-learning; Metalearning; Performance; Search spaces; Transparency","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Computer Society; US National Science Foundation (NSF)","22nd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2022","28 November 2022 through 1 December 2022","Orlando","186593","23759232","979-835034609-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148462482"

These methods have severe limitations with important consequences for outcomes such as fairness. Among model-agnostic IML methods, visualizations such as the partial dependence plot (PDP) or individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots are popular and useful for displaying qualitative relationships. Although we focus on fairness auditing with PDP/ICE plots, the consequences we highlight generalize to other auditing or IML/xAI applications.

The findings show that greenwashing research is prevalent in developed countries and continues to attract more scholars globally, focusing on the interpretation of greenwashing definitions and concepts, influencing factors, consequences and governance models. Finally, this paper introduces the system governance theory and improves organizational isomorphism theory to further generalize the existing research framework on greenwashing and provides an outlook on the future direction of greenwashing research from three perspectives: greening screening research, impact research and governance research. © 2023 by the authors.","bibliometric analysis; CiteSpace; corporate social responsibility; greenwashing; marketing ethics; systems governance","bibliography; corporate social responsibility; database; environmental protection; ethnic group; exploration; governance approach; knowledge; marketing; visualization","MDPI","","","","","","20711050","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147978195"

However, when applied to panorama saliency detection, the method results in additional computational overhead due to repeatedly sampling overlapping regions of adjacent convolution positions along the longitude. In order to solve this problem, we improved the calculation process of “Mapped Convolution”. Rather than accessing adjacency list during the convolution, we first sample the panorama based on the adjacency list for only once and obtain a sampled map. This sampling process is called the decoupled sampling of “Mapped Convolution”. And then the map is convoluted in traditional 2D way, thus avoiding repeatedly sampling. In this paper, an interpolation method based on the Softmax function is also proposed and applied to the interpolation calculation of decoupled sampling. Compared with common interpolation methods such as linear interpolation, this interpolation method makes our network more efficient during training. We additionally introduce a new adaptive equator bias algorithm allowing for different attention distributions at different longitudes, which is more consistent with viewer's visual behavior. Combining the U-Autoencoder network containing the decoupled sampling with the adaptive equator bias algorithm, we construct a 360-degree visual saliency detection model. We map the original panorama into a cube, and then use the the cube isometric mapping method to remap it into a panorama and input it into the network for training. Then, the crude saliency map output by the decoder is combined with the equator bias map to obtain the final saliency map. The results show that the model proposed is superior to recent state-of-the-art models in terms of computational speed and saliency-map prediction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","360-degree visual saliency detection; Adaptive equatorial bias; Mapped Convolutions; Sampling interpolation","Interpolation; Learning systems; Mapping; Visualization; 360-degree visual saliency detection; Adaptive equatorial bias; Adjacency lists; Decoupled samplings; Interpolation method; Mapped convolution; Saliency map; Sampling interpolation; Visual saliency detections; Convolution","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","01782789","","VICOE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124554361"

However, for a robot to establish itself, a user must accept and trust its doing. As the saying goes, you don't trust things you don't understand. Therefore, the base hypothesis of this paper is that providing technical transparency for users can increase understanding of the robot architecture and its behaviors as well as trust and acceptance towards it. In this work, we aim to improve a robot's understanding, trust, and acceptance by displaying transparent visualizations of its intention and perception in augmented reality. We conducted a user study where robot navigation with certain interruptions was demonstrated to two groups. The first group did not have AR visualizations displayed during the first demonstration; in the second demonstration, the visualizations were shown. The second group had the visualizations displayed throughout only one demonstration. Results showed that understanding increased with AR visualizations when prior knowledge had been gained in previous demonstrations. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization-while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","cognitive bias; Progressive visualization","Bias; Cognition; Computer Graphics; Uncertainty; Visualization; Cognitive bias; Intermediate results; Large amounts of data; Potential risks; Progressive visualization; Recent researches; Task completion time; cognition; computer graphics; statistical bias; uncertainty; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099541750"

This lack of interpretability is significantly limiting the adoption of such models in domains where decisions are critical such as the medical and legal fields. Recently, researchers have been interested in developing methods that help explain individual decisions and decipher the hidden representations of machine learning models in general and deep networks specifically. While there has been a recent explosion of work on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (ExAI) on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data.Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges and present satisfactory explanations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation practices and metrics are proposed.Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained models in a post hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word embeddings (input level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing level), and (3) models' decisions (output level). We also detail the different evaluation approaches interpretability methods in the NLP field. Finally, we present a case-study on the well-known neural machine translation in an appendix, and we propose promising future research directions for ExAI in the NLP field.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","ExAI; explaining decisions; language models; neural machine translation; NLP; transformers; transparent embedding models","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Data visualization; Natural language processing systems; Neural machine translation; Embeddings; Explainable artificial intelligence; Explaining decision; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Processing model; Transformer; Transparent embedding model; Embeddings","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","03600300","","ACSUE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133230102"

One of the extending parts is where the model can accommodate complex and advanced marine properties and cadastral objects. Currently, the fundamentals part of this new version (LADM Edition II) has been examined by the committee, and a few elements need to be considered, especially for marine space georegulation. Based on the possibility of embedding LADM with marine cadastre as agreed by several researchers, the concept of marine cadastre data model within land administration context has been anticipated in many countries (e.g., Canada, Greece, Turkey, Australia, and Malaysia). Part of the research focused on constructing and developing the appropriate data models to manage marine spaces and resources most effectively. Several studies have attempted to establish a conceptual model for marine cadastre in Malaysia. However, there is still no acceptable marine data model. Thus, this paper proposed a marine data model for Malaysia based on the international standard, LADM. The approach, by definition, can be applied to the marine environment in terms of controlling and modelling a variety of rights, responsibilities, and restrictions. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) application was utilized to construct the conceptual and technical models via Enterprise Architect as part of the validation process. The data model was constructed within the marine's concept in Malaysia to meet international standards. The features of the data model were also discussed in the FIG workshop (9th LADM International Workshop 2021). The experiment on the data model also includes 3D visualization and simple query.  © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

However, since time is a value-laden concept, and no representation can provide a full, objective account of “temporal reality”, they are also biased and political: reproducing and reinforcing certain views and values at the expense of alternative ones. This conceptual paper aims to explore expressions of temporal bias and politics in data visualisation, along with possibly mitigating user approaches and design strategies. Design/methodology/approach: This study presents a theoretical framework rooted in a sociotechnical view of representations as biased and political, combined with perspectives from critical literacy, radical literacy and critical design. The framework provides a basis for discussion of various types and effects of temporal bias in visualisation. Empirical examples from previous research and public resources illustrate the arguments. Findings: Four types of political effects of temporal bias in visualisations are presented, expressed as limitation of view, disregard of variation, oppression of social groups and misrepresentation of topic and suggest that appropriate critical and radical literacy approaches require users and designers to critique, contextualise, counter and cross beyond expressions of the same. Supporting critical design strategies involve the inclusion of multiple datasets and representations; broad access to flexible tools; and inclusive participation of marginalised groups. Originality/value: The paper draws attention to a vital, yet little researched problem of temporal representation in visualisations of data. It offers a pioneering bridging of critical literacy, radical literacy and critical design and emphasises mutual rather than contradictory interests of the empirical sciences and humanities. © 2021, Veronica Johansson and Jörgen Stenlund.","Bias; Critical design; Critical literacy; Data; Radical literacy; Representation; Temporality; Time; Visualisation","","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.","","","","","","00220418","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117178581"

Notwithstanding the benefits of AI tools, healthcare industry data has become a central target for many cyber invaders in this era of big data, as they are regarded as valuable information. Health care data breaches occur due to unauthorized access to patients' health records that violate the privacy and security of confidential health information.

End users hold the promise to expand this purview, as they inhabit spaces and witness algorithmic impacts that auditors do not. In pursuit of this goal, we propose end-user audits-system-scale audits led by non-technical users-and present an approach that scaffolds end users in hypothesis generation, evidence identification, and results communication. Today, performing a system-scale audit requires substantial user effort to label thousands of system outputs, so we introduce a collaborative filtering technique that leverages the algorithmic system's own disaggregated training data to project from a small number of end user labels onto the full test set. Our end-user auditing tool, IndieLabel, employs these predicted labels so that users can rapidly explore where their opinions diverge from the algorithmic system's outputs. By highlighting topic areas where the system is under-performing for the user and surfacing sets of likely error cases, the tool guides the user in authoring an audit report. In an evaluation of end-user audits on a popular comment toxicity model with 17 non-technical participants, participants both replicated issues that formal audits had previously identified and also raised previously underreported issues such as under-flagging on veiled forms of hate that perpetuate stigma and over-flagging of slurs that have been reclaimed by marginalized communities. © 2022 ACM.","algorithm auditing; algorithmic fairness; human-centered ai; interactive visualization; machine learning","Collaborative filtering; Scaffolds; Visualization; Algorithm auditing; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; End-users; Human-centered ai; Interactive visualizations; Large-scales; Machine-learning; System output; Technical experts; Machine learning","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","25730142","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140194805"

Currently, computer science courses that cover AI fairness and bias focus on statistical analysis or, on the other hand, attempt to bring in philosophical perspectives that lack actionable takeaways for students. Based on long-standing pedagogical research demonstrating the importance of using tools and visualizations to reinforce student learning, this case study reports on the impacts of using publicly-available visualization tools used in HCI practice as a resource for students examining algorithmic fairness concepts. Through qualitative review and observations of four focus groups, we examined six open-source fairness tools that enable students to visualize, quantify and explore algorithmic biases. The findings of this study provide insights into the benefits, challenges, and opportunities of integrating fairness tools as part of machine learning education. © 2022 Owner/Author.","Ethics; Fairness; Tools","Education computing; Ethical technology; Machine learning; Visualization; Algorithmics; Artificial intelligence systems; Case-studies; Computer Science course; Fairness; High educations; Machine-learning; Media attention; Media research; Visualization tools; Students","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGCHI","2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI EA 2022","30 April 2022 through 5 May 2022","Virtual, Online","179030","","978-145039156-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129702990"

A fundamental challenge of FL is non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data, which can be addressed by clustered FL (CFL) that explores inherent partitions among clients to capture heterogeneous local data distributions. Existing CFL methods, however, tend to optimise the mean accuracy across all clients, overlooking the important issue of fairness, that is, uniformity of clients' performance. Besides, prior FL- related visual analytics (VA) frameworks are developed based on the standard FL scenario of single global model and are hence inapplicable to the CFL case of multiple global (cluster) models. To fill the research gap, this study proposes a novel VA framework named cCFLvis to illustrate and analyse variation of fairness during the CFL learning process. A new metric, change of absolute deviation from the mean (ΔAD), is introduced to quantify such variation. Client embeddings are generated by contrastive learning-based dimensionality reduction techniques to facilitate 2-d visualisation of client disparity. Visual cues can be drawn to help understand fairness variation and to offer clues for improving learning outcomes. cCFL vis is a general framework applicable to various CFL methods. Its effectiveness is showcased in a simple demonstration and two case studies, each conducted with a distinct representative CFL method and a different federated non-IID dataset. © 2023 IEEE.","clustered federated learning; fairness; non-IID datasets; visual analytics","Learning systems; Privacy-preserving techniques; Visualization; Clustered federated learning; Fairness; Global models; IID data; Independently and identically distributed; Machine learning approaches; Non-independently and identically distributed dataset; Privacy preserving; Training data; Visual analytics; Data visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Business Events Australia; Destination Goldcoast; et al.; International Neural Network Society (INNS); The University of Queensland Australia; Tourism and Events Queensland","2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2023","18 June 2023 through 23 June 2023","Gold Coast","191330","","978-166548867-9","85OFA","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169575684"

One unexplored development is the ability to design machine-generated voices that induce varying levels of &#x201C;shakiness&#x201D; (i.e., trembling) in the agents&#x0027; voices. In the current work, we examine how the trembling voice of a conversational AI impacts users&#x0027; perceptions, affective experiences, and their subsequent behavior. Across three studies, we demonstrate that a trembling voice enhances the perceived psychological vulnerability of the agent, followed by a heightened sense of empathic concern, ultimately increasing people&#x0027;s willingness to donate in a prosocial charity context. We provide further evidence from a large-scale field experiment that conversational agents with a trembling voice lead to increased click-through rates and decreased costs-per-impression in an online charity advertising setting. These findings deepen our understanding of the nuanced impact of intentionally designed voices of conversational AI agents on humans and highlight the ethical and societal challenges that arise.

AI Planning is one type of task that provides explanation challenges, particularly due to the increasing complexity in generated plans and convoluted causal chains that connect actions and determine the overall plan structure. While there are many recent techniques to support plan explanation, visual aids for navigating this data are quite limited. Furthermore, there is often a barrier between techniques focused on abstract planning concepts and domain-related explanations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics tool to support plan summarization and interaction, focusing in robotics domains using an actor-based structure. We show how users can quickly grasp vital information about actions involved in a plan and how they relate to each other. Finally, we present a framework used to design our tool, highlighting how general PDDL elements can be converted into visual representations and further connecting concept to domain. © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.","","AI planning; AI systems; Analytic tools; Causal chains; Interactive visualizations; Legal liability; Visual aids; Visual analytics; Visual representations; Visualization","Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence","Artificial Intelligence, David E.

However, in the case of information visualization, there are several unique and complex challenges, chief among them: defining and measuring trust. In this paper, we investigate the factors that influence trust in visualizations. We draw on the literature to identify five factors likely to affect trust: credibility, clarity, reliability, familiarity, and confidence. We then conduct two studies investigating these factors' relationship with visualization design features. In the first study, participants' credibility, understanding, and reliability ratings depended on the visualization design and its source. In the second study, we find these factors also align with subjective trust rankings. Our findings suggest that these five factors are important considerations for the design of trustworthy visualizations.  © 2023 IEEE.","Human-centered computing; Visualization; Visualization design and evaluation methods","Information systems; Computational field; Design and evaluation methods; Design features; Human-centered computing; Information visualization; Subjective trust; Visualization design and evaluation method; Visualization designs; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2023 IEEE Visualization Conference, VIS 2023","22 October 2023 through 27 October 2023","Hybrid, Melbourne","195705","","979-835032557-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182589257"

The task of studying such encoded representations is referred to as model interpretation. Efforts along this direction, despite being proved efficient, stand with two weaknesses. First, there is low semanticity on the feedback they provide which leads toward subjective visualizations. Second, there is no unified protocol for the quantitative evaluation of interpretation methods which makes the comparison between current and future methods complex.To address these issues, we propose a unified evaluation protocol for the quantitative evaluation of interpretation methods. This is achieved by enhancing existing interpretation methods to be capable of generating visual explanations and then linking these explanations with a semantic label. To achieve this, we introduce the Weighted Average Intersection-over-Union (WAIoU) metric to estimate the coverage rate between explanation heatmaps and semantic annotations. This is complemented with an analysis of several binarization techniques for heatmaps, necessary when measuring coverage. Experiments considering several interpretation methods covering different CNN architectures pre-trained on multiple datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. © 2023 IEEE.","accountable; Algorithms: Explainable; ethical computer vision; fair; privacy-preserving; Visualization","Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Network architecture; Privacy-preserving techniques; Semantics; Accountable; Algorithm: explainable; Convolutional neural network; Ethical computer vision; Fair; Heatmaps; Interpretation methods; Model interpretations; Privacy preserving; Quantitative evaluation; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","CVF; IEEE Computer Society","23rd IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision, WACV 2023","3 January 2023 through 7 January 2023","Waikoloa","186583","","978-166549346-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149020670"

The proposed reconstruction method uses a single monocular photo and predicts its depth values based on a monocular depth estimation network. While most recent studies have focused on scenes with sharp (high-curvature) edges and large depth differences, such as indoor and outdoor scenes, the proposed method is designed to exert its performance on scenes with small depth differences and soft (low-curvature) edges. The key idea is to involve the soft edges as guidance information in the depth estimation network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to the hidden reliefs of the Borobudur temple, a UNESCO world heritage site. The hidden reliefs were buried behind stone walls and are no longer visible. The 3D information of the reliefs can only be estimated from their old monocular photos. We achieved 97% reconstruction accuracy for validation data. We also integrate the reconstructed hidden reliefs with 3D scanned data of the visible regions and execute see-through visualization for the integrated data.

We present an elegant mathematical solution that tackles both issues simultaneously, using image classification as a working example. By treating a classification model's predictions for a given image as a set of labels analogous to a ""bag of words"", we rank the biases that a model has learned with respect to different identity labels. We use man, woman as a concrete example of an identity label set (although this set need not be binary), and present rankings for the labels that are most biased towards one identity or the other. We demonstrate how the statistical properties of different association metrics can lead to different rankings of the most ""gender biased""labels, and conclude that normalized pointwise mutual information (nPMI) is most useful in practice. Finally, we announce an open-sourced nPMI visualization tool using TensorBoard. © 2021 Owner/Author.","bias; datasets; fairness; image tagging; information extraction; model analysis; stereotypes","Artificial intelligence; Philosophical aspects; Classification models; Identity labels; Mathematical solutions; Measuring model; Model performance; Pointwise mutual information; Statistical properties; Visualization tools; Information retrieval","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","AAAI; ACM SIGAI","4th AAAI/ACM Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society, AIES 2021","19 May 2021 through 21 May 2021","Virtual, Online","170685","","978-145038473-5","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112427681"

However, risk models de-veloped on one dataset may not generalize across diverse subpop-ulations of patients in different datasets and may have unexpected performance. It is challenging for clinical researchers to inspect risk models across different subgroups without any tools. Therefore, we developed an interactive visualization system called RMExplorer (Risk Model Explorer) to enable interactive risk model assessment. Specifically, the system allows users to define subgroups of patients by selecting clinical, demographic, or other characteristics, to ex-plore the performance and fairness of risk models on the subgroups, and to understand the feature contributions to risk scores. To demonstrate the usefulness of the tool, we conduct a case study, where we use RMExplorer to explore three atrial fibrillation risk models by applying them to the UK Biobank dataset of 445,329 individuals. RMExplorer can help researchers to evaluate the performance and biases of risk models on subpopulations of interest in their data.  © 2022 IEEE.","electronic health records; explainability; fairness; health informatics; Human-centered computing; interpretability; subgroup analysis; visual analytics; Visualization","Medical informatics; Risk assessment; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Explainability; Fairness; Health informatics; Health records; Human-centered computing; Interpretability; Subgroup analyse; Visual analytics; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2022 IEEE Visualization Conference, VIS 2022","16 October 2022 through 21 October 2022","Virtual, Online","185101","","978-166548812-9","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145557260"

Until now, most research into algorithmic transparency has predominantly focused on explainability. Explainability attempts to provide reasons for a machine learning model's behavior to stakeholders. However, understanding a model's specific behavior alone might not be enough for stakeholders to gauge whether the model is wrong or lacks sufficient knowledge to solve the task at hand. In this paper, we argue for considering a complementary form of transparency by estimating and communicating the uncertainty associated with model predictions. First, we discuss methods for assessing uncertainty. Then, we characterize how uncertainty can be used to mitigate model unfairness, augment decision-making, and build trustworthy systems. Finally, we outline methods for displaying uncertainty to stakeholders and recommend how to collect information required for incorporating uncertainty into existing ML pipelines. This work constitutes an interdisciplinary review drawn from literature spanning machine learning, visualization/HCI, design, decision-making, and fairness.

It is important to understand how users' trust is affected by ML models' suggestions, even when those models are wrong. Many research efforts have focused on the user's ability to interpret what a model has learned. In this paper, we seek to understand another aspect of ML interpretability: how the presence of classification probabilities affects users' trust in the model outcomes, especially in ambiguous instances. To this end, we conducted an online survey in which we asked participants to evaluate their agreement with an automatic classification made by an ML model before and after presenting them the model classification probabilities. Surprisingly, we found that, in ambiguous instances, respondents agreed more with incorrect model outcomes than with correct ones, requiring further analyses.  © 2021 IEEE.","data visualization; human-centered AI; human-centered machine learning; trust","Data visualization; Machine learning; Surveys; Human being; Human-centered AI; Human-centered machine learning; Large-scales; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Pressung; Research efforts; Trust; Probability","IEEE Computer Society","","2021 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing, VL/HCC 2021","10 October 2021 through 13 October 2021","St. Louis","173294","19436092","978-166544592-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118759321"

For the graph mining community in particular, an important goal toward algorithmic fairness is to detect and mitigate bias incorporated into graph embeddings since they are commonly used in human-centered applications, e.g., social-media recommendations. However, simple analytical methods for detecting bias typically involve aggregate statistics which do not reveal the sources of unfairness. Instead, visual methods can provide a holistic fairness characterization of graph embeddings and help uncover the causes of observed bias. In this work, we present BIASCOPE, an interactive visualization tool that supports end-to-end visual unfairness diagnosis for graph embeddings. The tool is the product of a design study in collaboration with domain experts. It allows the user to (i) visually compare two embeddings with respect to fairness, (ii) locate nodes or graph communities that are unfairly embedded, and (iii) understand the source of bias by interactively linking the relevant embedding subspace with the corresponding graph topology. Experts' feedback confirms that our tool is effective at detecting and diagnosing unfairness. Thus, we envision our tool both as a companion for researchers in designing their algorithms as well as a guide for practitioners who use off-the-shelf graph embeddings. © 2022 IEEE.","algorithmic fairness; Graph embeddings; network visualization","Graph embeddings; Product design; Topology; Algorithmic fairness; Algorithmics; Embeddings; Graph embeddings; Graph mining; Machine learning models; Media recommendations; Mining communities; Network visualization; Social media; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2022 IEEE Visualization in Data Science, VDS 2022","16 October 2022","Virtual, Online","185394","","978-166545721-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146232786"

These systems became more powerful over the last decades and provide more features to satisfy user needs than previous generations of ERP systems. Furthermore, they are integrated with other cloud-based systems. [Question/problem] The resulting increase in complexity leads to a higher probability of failures within this integrated system. This makes it difficult for users to fully understand these systems and even qualified key users don't have an overview of possible system issues anymore. As a result, the number of support calls and diffuse support ticket requests have increased in the last years. Moreover, ERP partner organizations such as insideAx experience that users lose trust in their systems. [Principal idea/results] The goal of our work is to foster the trust of ERP users in cloud-based ERP systems and to reduce the number of unnecessary support requests, by enhancing existing user feedback and monitoring mechanisms and provide a visualization of system health indicators to users. Overall, these visualizations and explanations of the system health status need to be easy to understand by users. [Contribution] In this workshop paper, we provide insights from industry on how to foster user trust in complex software systems and depict a conceptual solution which makes use of system monitoring data to communicate the system status to users in a simple and understandable way. Our conceptual solution, for which we also provide a first implementation architecture proposal, foresees that simple modifications to the software and ambient light devices allow to build such visualizations.

Interpretation also builds a necessary degree of trust and transparency between the doctor, patient, and system.

The limited human-collective transparency research has focused on how the design of the models (i.e., algorithms), visualizations, and control mechanisms influence human-collective behaviors. Traditional collective visualizations have shown all of the individual entities composing a collective, which may become problematic as collectives scale in size and heterogeneity, and tasks become more demanding. Human operators can become overloaded with information, which will negatively affect their understanding of the collective’s current state and overall behaviors, which can cause poor teaming performance. This manuscript contributes to the human-collective domain by analyzing how visualization transparency influences remote supervision of collectives. The visualization transparency analysis expands traditional transparency assessments by focusing on how operators with different individual capabilities are impacted, their comprehension, the interface usability, and the human-collective team’s performance. Metrics that effectively assess visualization transparency of collectives are identified, and design guidance can inform future real-world human-collective systems designs.

Such bias can be mitigated by incorporating both objective as well as subjective (through human users) measures of bias, and compensating for them by means of a suitable selection algorithm over subgroups of training data. In this paper, we propose a methodology of integrating bias detection and mitigation strategies through interactive visualization of machine learning models in selected protected spaces. In this approach, a (partially generated) ML model performance is visualized and evaluated by a human user or a community of human users in terms of potential presence of bias using both objective and subjective criteria. Guided by such human feedback, the ML algorithm can implement a variety of remedial sampling strategies to mitigate the bias using an iterative human-in-The-loop approach. We also provide experimental results with a benchmark ML dataset to demonstrate that such an interactive ML approach holds considerable promise in detecting and mitigating bias in ML models.  © 2021 IEEE.","bias; fairness; human-computer interaction; machine learning; visualization","Human computer interaction; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Bias; Fairness; Human users; Interactive approach; Machine learning algorithms; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Mitigation strategy; Selection algorithm; Training data; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Computational Intelligence Society; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE SMC Society","20th IEEE International Conference on Cognitive Informatics and Cognitive Computing, ICCI*CC 2021","29 October 2021 through 31 October 2021","Banff","180660","","978-166542119-5","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85135382968"

The rendering of transparent lines is widely used for visualizing trajectories of tracer particles in flow fields. Transparency is then used to fade out lines deemed unimportant, based on, for instance, geometric properties or attributes defined along with them. Accurate blending of transparent lines requires rendering the lines in back-to-front or front-to-back order, yet enforcing this order for space-filling 3D line sets with extremely high-depth complexity becomes challenging. In this article, we study CPU and GPU rendering techniques for transparent 3D line sets. We compare accurate and approximate techniques using optimized implementations and several benchmark data sets. We discuss the effects of data size and transparency on quality, performance, and memory consumption. Based on our study, we propose two improvements to per-pixel fragment lists and multi-layer alpha blending. The first improves the rendering speed via an improved GPU sorting operation, and the second improves rendering quality via transparency-based bucketing. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","line rendering; order-independent transparency; Scientific visualization","Blending; Three dimensional computer graphics; Transparency; Alpha blending; Benchmark data; Depth complexity; Geometric properties; Memory consumption; Optimized implementation; Rendering quality; Tracer particle; Rendering (computer graphics)","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111789182"

A way to engage citizens is to make available government data as open. This allows achieving a higher transparency in decision-making that also fosters citizens to support the strategic objectives of the city and improve the individual and collective quality of life. The goal of this paper is to show the effectiveness of chorems as a communication and support tool for understanding the dynamic realities of a territory. When used to visually synthesize urban contexts, maps of chorems can produce a territorial schematic representation, which eliminates details not useful to the map comprehension, and emphasizes relevant information to enable decision makers, experts and ordinary citizens to share knowledge about complex phenomena occurring in urban areas. A use case is built, which describes how the urban heat island phenomenon and the factors involved in its development are analyzed through a set of chorems and operators. This phenomenon is invisible but typically present in most of the modern cities. It is composed of different urban elements present on the urban territory and its understanding implies technical and scientific knowledge not common among citizens and administrators. By visually interacting with chorems, it is possible support data manipulation by expert users, and data interpretation by citizens, thus aligning the different actors of a smart community towards a shared sustainability goal. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Chorems; GeoVisualization; Smart communities; Urban heat islands","Atmospheric temperature; Data visualization; Decision making; Open Data; Transparency; Urban planning; Chorem; Decisions makings; Geovisualization; High transparency; Interactive maps; Quality of life; Smart community; Strategic objectives; Urban context; Urban heat island; Smart city","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","21st International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications, ICCSA 2021","13 September 2021 through 16 September 2021","Virtual, Online","265069","03029743","978-303086975-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115734302"

One of the main challenges in GZSL is a biased model prediction toward seen classes caused by overfitting on only available seen class data during training. To overcome this issue, we propose a two-stream autoencoder-based gating model for GZSL. Our gating model predicts whether the query data is from seen classes or unseen classes, and utilizes separate seen and unseen experts to predict the class independently from each other. This framework avoids comparing the biased prediction scores for seen classes with the prediction scores for unseen classes. In particular, we measure the distance between visual and attribute representations in the latent space and the cross-reconstruction space of the autoencoder. These distances are utilized as complementary features to characterize unseen classes at different levels of data abstraction. Also, the two-stream autoencoder works as a unified framework for the gating model and the unseen expert, which makes the proposed method computationally efficient. We validate our proposed method in four benchmark image recognition datasets. In comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the best harmonic mean accuracy in SUN and AWA2, and the second best in CUB and AWA1. Furthermore, our base model requires at least 20% less number of model parameters than state-of-the-art methods relying on generative models.

In many cases, domain experts - who often have no expertise in ML or data science - are asked to use ML predictions to make high-stakes decisions. Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user trust in the model, inability to reconcile human-ML disagreement, and ethical concerns about oversimplification of complex problems to a single algorithm output. In this paper, we investigate the ML usability challenges that present in the domain of child welfare screening through a series of collaborations with child welfare screeners. Following the iterative design process between the ML scientists, visualization researchers, and domain experts (child screeners), we first identified four key ML challenges and honed in on one promising explainable ML technique to address them (local factor contributions). Then we implemented and evaluated our visual analytics tool, Sibyl, to increase the interpretability and interactivity of local factor contributions. The effectiveness of our tool is demonstrated by two formal user studies with 12 non-expert participants and 13 expert participants respectively. Valuable feedback was collected, from which we composed a list of design implications as a useful guideline for researchers who aim to develop an interpretable and interactive visualization tool for ML prediction models deployed for child welfare screeners and other similar domain experts.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","child welfare; Machine learning; Usability; visualization; XAI","Forecasting; Iterative methods; Machine learning; Usability engineering; Visualization; Child welfare; Context models; Decisions makings; Domain experts; Ethical concerns; Factor contribution; Machine-learning; Prediction algorithms; Predictive models; XAI; article; child; child welfare; clinical article; decision making; female; human; human experiment; machine learning; male; practice guideline; prediction; usability; Decision making","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118642177"

We propose that machine vision systems are inherently biased not only because they rely on biased datasets but also because their perceptual topology, their specific way of representing the visual world, gives rise to a new class of bias that we call perceptual bias. Concretely, we define perceptual topology as the set of those inductive biases in machine vision systems that determine its capability to represent the visual world. Perceptual bias, then, describes the difference between the assumed “ways of seeing” of a machine vision system, our reasonable expectations regarding its way of representing the visual world, and its actual perceptual topology. We show how perceptual bias affects the interpretability of machine vision systems in particular, by means of a close reading of a visualization technique called “feature visualization”. We conclude that dataset bias and perceptual bias both need to be considered in the critical analysis of machine vision systems and propose to understand critical machine vision as an important transdisciplinary challenge, situated at the interface of computer science and visual studies/Bildwissenschaft. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bias; Computer vision; Interpretability; Machine learning; Perception","Machinery; Topology; Turing machines; Visualization; Critical analysis; Critical machine; Inductive bias; Interpretability; Machine vision systems; Visual world; Visualization technique; Computer vision","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","09515666","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092414002"

DExDs are a collection of semi-interactive web-based documents used to promote design discourse: to communicate new visualization designs, and their underlying rationale, and to elicit feedback and new design ideas. Developed and applied during a four-year visual data analysis project in criminal intelligence, these documents enabled a series of visualization re-designs to be explored by crime analysts remotely - in a flexible and authentic way. The DExDs were found to engender a level of engagement that is qualitatively distinct from more traditional methods of feedback elicitation, supporting the kind of informed, iterative and design-led feedback that is core to applied visualization research. They also offered a solution to limited and intermittent contact between analyst and visualization researcher and began to address more intractable deficiencies, such as social desirability-bias, common to applied visualization projects. Crucially, DExDs conferred to domain experts greater agency over the design process - collaborators proposed design suggestions, justified with design knowledge, that directly influenced the re-redesigns. We provide context that allows the contributions to be transferred to a range of settings. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","concurrent evaluation; crime analysis; design discourse; design exposition; Design methodology; design study; geospatial data; remote collaboration; statistical process control; temporal data; visual representation design","Data visualization; Exhibitions; Iterative methods; Knowledge acquisition; Visualization; Criminal intelligence; Design discourse; Design suggestions; Intermittent-contacts; Social desirability; Visual data analysis; Visualization designs; Visualization research; article; crime; data analysis; human; intelligence; social desirability bias; Design","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111789451"

The interpretability of these profiles for end users, e.g. policymakers, is often far from trivial. How and why these models are obtained by the applications are often regarded as a black box. In recent years several profiling applications used by public organizations have led to wrong interpretations of the obtained models and impacted individuals and society adversely. Hence, the research focus has increasingly shifted towards dealing with the trust and interpretability issues of the models. In support of a more careful and proper interpretation of these models, several scholars have advocated a glass box approach that aims at making these models more transparent to end users. In this paper, we operationalize the glass box approach for a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based profiling application. To enhance the interpretability of the models provided by the application, we aim at facilitating the interaction of domain experts with the models. Hereby domain experts can gain insight to the evolvement of the profiles and what happens to the profiles if we change or add a new pieces of information. Adding such an interactive visualization provides more transparency about the derived models, making them more understandable for end users and policymakers. As a result, they can better assess and explain the consequences of those models when they apply to practice. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","AI; Algorithms; Glass box; Profiling; Transparency","Electronic commerce; Genetic algorithms; Glass; Visualization; Domain experts; Gain insight; Interactive visualizations; Interpretability; Policy makers; Profiling application; Public organizations; Research focus; Data visualization","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","20th IFIP WG 6.11 Conference on e-Business, e-Services and e-Society, I3E 2021","1 September 2021 through 3 September 2021","Galway","264489","03029743","978-303085446-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115134614"

To develop AI systems, many principles (human rights, well-being, data agency, effectiveness, transparency, accountability, awareness of misuse and competence) must be considered to ensure that the AI is trustworthy and applicable. The current computerised ECG interpretation algorithms can detect different types of heart diseases. However, there are some challenges and shortcomings that need to be addressed, such as the explainability issue and the interaction between the human and the AI for clinical decision making. These challenges create opportunities to develop a trustworthy XAI for automated ECG interpretation with a high performance and a high confidence level. This study reports a proposed XAI interface design in automatic ECG interpretation based on suggestions from previous studies and based on standard guidelines that were developed by the human computer interaction (HCI) community. New XAI interfaces should be developed in the future that facilitate more transparency of the decision logic of the algorithm which may allow users to calibrate their trust and use of the AI system. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence (AI); ECG interpretation; Explainable AI (XAI)","Behavioral research; Data visualization; Decision making; Electrocardiography; Human computer interaction; Transparency; User interfaces; Visualization; Clinical decision making; Decision logic; ECG interpretation; Heart disease; High confidence; Human computer interaction (HCI); Interface designs; Standard guidelines; Artificial intelligence","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","AVI 2020 Workshop on Road Mapping Infrastructures for Artificial Intelligence Supporting Advanced Visual Big Data Analysis, AVI-BDA 2020 and 2nd Italian Workshop on Visualization and Visual Analytics, ITAVIS 2020","29 September 2020 through 29 September 2020","Ischia","255339","03029743","978-303068006-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102652393"

In particular, trust perception is the user's subjective evaluation of the quality and reliability of the visualized information. However, research leveraging information visualization techniques to study trust perception is limited. This work studies whether varying the temporal framing of line charts affects trust perception in an uncertain scenario. Our results suggest that granularity may be relevant for time-based visualization design. In particular, individuals trust more in a line chart with a higher number of data points and interact more with a line chart in which they trust less. These findings contribute to the state-of-the-art research in visual analytic systems by empowering designers to understand how trust perception in a health emergency scenario varies for line charts with different temporal frames.  © 2022 IEEE.","information visualization; time-series; trust; user interaction","Information analysis; Information systems; Visualization; Information visualization; Subjective evaluations; Time series visualization; Time-based visualisation; Times series; Trust; User interaction; Visualization designs; Visualization technique; Work study; Time series","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2022 International Conference on Graphics and Interaction, ICGI 2022","3 November 2022 through 4 November 2022","Aveiro","185411","","979-835034573-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146277288"

Visualizing these data helps us to understand the complicated internal structure of the cultural heritage. Transparent stereoscopic visualization based on 3D point clouds is effective for understanding the complex structures of cultural heritage. However, the position and depth information often become unclear when three-dimensional data are rendered transparently. We examined whether perceived depth of transparently and stereoscopically visualized objects can be improved by highlighting 3D edges of the structure. We also investigated the effect of edge opacity on perceived depth. We tested two types of figures: vertically and horizontally combined shapes and diagonally combined shapes, which is extracted from the point cloud data of cultural heritage. We conducted psychophysical experiments, and the results suggest that edge highlighting improves the accuracy of perceived depth. Moreover, the effect of edge highlighting was more significant when binocular disparity and motion parallax were available. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Depth perception; Edge highlighting; Transparent stereoscopic visualization; Visual guide","Geometrical optics; Historic preservation; Stereo image processing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; Visualization; 3D point cloud; Complexes structure; Cultural heritages; Digital Archiving; Edge highlighting; Internal structure; Laser scanned; Stereoscopic visualization; Transparent stereoscopic visualization; Visual guide; Depth perception","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","21st Asia Simulation Conference, AsiaSim 2022","9 December 2022 through 11 December 2022","Changsha","288449","18650929","978-981199197-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146644287"

This can cause fear mongering and confusion on how to interpret the predictions provided by these models. This article proposes a solution for such a model that was created by a Canadian institute for COVID-19 in their region; namely, the NorthCOVID-19 model. In taking these ethical concerns into consideration, first the web interface of this model is analyzed to see how it may be difficult for a user without a strong mathematical background to understand how to use it. Second, a system is developed that takes this model's outputs as an input and produces a video summarization with an auto-generated audio to address the complexity of the interface, while ensuring that the end user is able to understand the important information produced by this model. A survey conducted on this proposed output asked participants, on a scale of 1 to 5, whether they strongly disagreed (1) or strongly agreed (5) with statements regarding the output of the proposed method. The results showed that the audio in the output was helpful in understanding the results (80% responded with 4 or 5) and that it helped improve overallcomprehension of the model (85% responded with 4 or 5). For the analysis of the NorthCOVID-19 interface, a System Usability Scale (SUS) survey was performed where itreceived a scoring of 70.94 which is slightly above the average of 68. © 2022.

In this research we deal with EthicApp, a collaborative application in which this problem is apparent, as students analyze a given ethics case individually and in small groups and deliver written judgements in each phase of the activity. We present a solution to the problem, based on enhancing EthicApp’s teacher’s interface with automated content analysis capabilities. This includes a dashboard that automatically displays students’ most relevant contributions, and cluster visualizations that permit identifying groups of students with similar responses to activity tasks. Validation of the approach was based on a dataset comprising 4,366 comments about an academic ethics case, which were written by 520 students divided into 19 class groups.

For this, it was supposed to use the visualization of the subject area, for example, optimization methods, on any information medium. Visualization can relieve unnecessary stress on the brain, which is expensive to store all the details of a problem situation. To represent the subject area, the structure of the binary tree of the system of questions and answers was chosen. The structure and methodology for obtaining it allowed us to present knowledge in a form that completely removes the known cognitive biases - false attribution, zero risk effect, Stockholm shopping syndrome, Barnum effect, Dunning-Kruger effect, “false consensus effect” and the “cognitive curmudgeon” phenomenon. The effects were considered in the aspect of choosing one of the most suitable alternatives from the whole variety of alternatives. As a result of the study, it was found that structured knowledge devoid of cognitive distortions makes it possible to find the most powerful solution to a problem, draw up an invention formula and obtain a new solution method. An example of the emergence of the geometric programming method as a new optimization method was considered. The reflexive approach proposed by the authors allows obtaining structured information about the studied subject area without distortion and finding new solution methods for solving new problems. Now the subject area can be obtained without heuristic errors with significant savings in mental energy.

However, this flexibility may introduce potential consequences in situations where users unknowingly overemphasize or underemphasize specific subsets of the data or attribute space they are analyzing. For example, users may overemphasize specific attributes and/or their values (e.g., Gender is always encoded on the X axis), underemphasize others (e.g., Religion is never encoded), ignore a subset of the data (e.g., older people are filtered out), etc. In response, we present Lumos, a visual data analysis tool that captures and shows the interaction history with data to increase awareness of such analytic behaviors. Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Analytic provenance; Awareness; Human bias; Interaction traces; Visual data analysis","Behavioral research; Data handling; Data visualization; Decision making; Hidden Markov models; Information analysis; Analytic provenance; Awareness; Data analysis tool; Ex situ; Hidden-Markov models; Human bias; Interaction trace; Older People; Specific subset; Visual data analysis; adult; article; awareness; clinical article; data analysis; decision making; female; human; human experiment; male; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113517962"

While fundamental ethical norms like truthfulness and accuracy are already well-described and common goals in visualization design, datasets that are accompanied by specific ethical concerns need to be processed and visualized with an additional level of carefulness and thought. There has been little research on adequate visualization design incorporating such considerations. To address this gap we present insights from Topography of Violence, a visualization project with the Jewish Museum Berlin that focuses on a dataset of more than 4,500 acts of violence against Jews in Germany between 1930 and 1938. Drawing from the joint project, we develop an approach to the visualization of sensitive data, which features both conceptual and procedural considerations for visualization design.

However, the majority of them suffer from system obesity and lack transparency on complex problems. In this paper, a novel classification approach with a multi-layered system structure self-organized from data is proposed. This approach is able to identify local peaks of multi-modal density derived from static data and filter out more representative ones at multiple levels of granularity acting as prototypes. These prototypes are then optimized to their locally optimal positions in the data space and arranged in layers with meaningful dense links in-between to form pyramidal hierarchies based on the respective levels of granularity accordingly. After being primed offline, the constructed classification model is capable of self-developing continuously from streaming data to self-expend its knowledge base. The proposed approach offers higher transparency and is convenient for visualization thanks to the hierarchical nested architecture. Its system identification process is objective, data-driven and free from prior assumptions on data generation model with user- and problem- specific parameters. Its decision-making process follows the “nearest prototype” principle, and is highly explainable and traceable. Numerical examples on a wide range of benchmark problems demonstrate its high performance. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Local optimality; Multi-granularity; Prototype-based; Pyramidal hierarchy","Data visualization; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Transparency; Classification approach; Complex problems; Local optimality; Multi-granularity; Multi-modal; Multilayered system; Prototype-based; Pyramidal hierarchy; Self-organised; Systems Structure; Benchmarking","Elsevier Inc.","","","","","","00200255","","ISIJB","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104661819"

If the outcomes are discrete, then some averaging is necessary to reduce the noise arising from the outcomes varying randomly over those discrete values in the observed data. The traditional method of averaging is to bin the data according to the scores and plot the average outcome in each bin against the average score in the bin. However, such binning can be rather arbitrary and yet greatly impacts the interpretation of displayed deviation between the subpopulations and assessment of its statistical significance. Fortunately, such binning is entirely unnecessary in plots of cumulative differences and in the associated scalar summary metrics that are analogous to the workhorse statistics of comparing probability distributions—those due to Kolmogorov and Smirnov and their refinements due to Kuiper. The present paper develops such cumulative methods for the common case in which no score of any member of the subpopulations being compared is exactly equal to the score of any other member of either subpopulation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Calibration; Equity; Fairness; Forecast; Histogram; Plot; Prediction; Reliability diagram; Stochastic; Visualization","Computational complexity; Probability distributions; Dependent variables; Equity; Fairness; Forecast; Graphical methods; Histogram; Independent variables; Plot; Reliability diagram; Stochastics; Stochastic systems","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21961115","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121370503"

This is however of primary importance in medical visualisation where raymarching of volumetric data is common. While rendering volumetric data itself is a well-explored area, perception of volume-rendered images combined with semi-transparent mesh data remains an underexplored topic. As virtual reality (VR) is increasingly employed for medical data inspection, it becomes important to understand how different mesh visualisations affect performance in medical tasks in this context. When considering direct volume rendering in immersive VR, the effects of stereoscopic vision and motion parallax require additional consideration. We investigate how surface transparency modes affect task performance in VR. For two medical image analysis tasks, we conduct a user study (n = 23) to analyse the impact of mesh rendering methods on task outcome and subjective preference. Our evaluation indicates that user performance with wireframe rendering varies greatly between tasks while constant opacity and silhouette provide a stable benefit. Overall, transparent visualisations led to improved precision (lower error rate, lower inter-observer variability) and increased user confidence, while the efficiency of visualisation methods was task-dependent. This demonstrates how semi-transparent rendering will improve visual analysis in medical applications and other disciplines (Formula presented.). © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","appendices; figures; fonts; lists; mathematics; references; Sections; tables","Geometrical optics; Medical applications; Medical imaging; Mesh generation; Stereo image processing; Virtual reality; Volume rendering; Volumetric analysis; Appendix; Figure; Font; List; Reference; Section; Semi-transparent; Table; Visualization method; Volumetric data; article; clinical article; human; image analysis; mathematics; stereoscopic vision; task performance; virtual reality; Visualization","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","21681163","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104715128"

However, due to cultural and perceptual biases, such metrics are often not powerful enough to accurately capture what people perceive as fair or unfair. To close the gap between human judgement and automated fairness evaluation, we develop a mixed-initiative system named FairAlign, where laypeople assess the fairness of different classification models by analyzing expressive and interactive visualizations of data. Using the aggregated qualitative feedback, data scientists and machine learning experts can examine the similarities and the differences between predefined fairness metrics and human judgement in a contextualized setting. To validate the utility of our system, we conducted a small study on a socially relevant classification task, where six people were asked to assess the fairness of multiple prediction models using the provided visualizations. The results show that our platform is able to give valuable guidance for model evaluation in case of otherwise contradicting and indecisive metrics for algorithmic fairness.  © 2022 IEEE.","Algorithmic-fairness; Contextualized-fairness; FairAlign; Fairness-assessment; Human-judgement; Mixed-initiative; Visual-analytics-system","Machine learning; Algorithmic-fairness; Algorithmics; Contextualized-fairness; Fairalign; Fairness evaluation; Fairness-assessment; Human judgments; Mixed-initiative; Mixed-initiative systems; Visual analytics systems; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2022 IEEE Workshop on TRust and EXpertise in Visual Analytics, TREX 2022","16 October 2022","Virtual, Online","185205","","978-166549356-7","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145778293"

The community of Information Retrieval (IR) relies on accurate and high-performance IE to be able to retrieve high quality results from massive datasets. One example of IE is to identify named entities in a text, e.g., “Barack Obama served as the president of the USA”. Here, Barack Obama and USA are named entities of types of PERSON and LOCATION, respectively. Another example is to identify sentiment expressed in a text, e.g., “This movie was awesome”. Here, the sentiment expressed is positive. Finally, identifying various linguistic aspects of a text, e.g., part of speech tags, noun phrases, dependency parses, etc., which can serve as features for additional IE tasks. This tutorial introduces participants to a) the usage of Python based, open-source tools that support IE from social media data (mainly Twitter), and b) best practices for ensuring the reproducibility of research. Participants will learn and practice various semantic and syntactic IE techniques that are commonly used for analyzing tweets. Additionally, participants will be familiarized with the landscape of publicly available tweet data, and methods for collecting and preparing them for analysis. Finally, participants will be trained to use a suite of open source tools (SAIL for active learning, TwitterNER for named entity recognition3, and SocialMediaIE for multi task learning), which utilize advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., deep learning, active learning with human-in-the-loop, multi-lingual, and multi-task learning) to perform IE on their own or existing datasets. Participants will also learn how social context can be integrated in Information Extraction systems to make them better. The tools introduced in the tutorial will focus on the three main stages of IE, namely, collection of data (including annotation), data processing and analytics, and visualization of the extracted information.

On the other hand, there are typical problems arising in the process of collecting data, such as the black bias problem in COMPAS and the fairness problem that exists within the data, such as the facial recognition bias problem. Accordingly, by designing and implementing a system that corrects fairness by removing bias existing in the dataset itself, we tried to help research on artificial intelligence models. The 'Fairness Improvement Technology and Visualization Services for binary classification datasets collected on a batch basis' consists of a subset generator that separates the initial binary classification datasets with unique values, a bias remover that removes bias by comparing and verifying each subset, and a visualization module that visualizes the corrected data as a web service. In addition, the proposed system in this paper presents a data-level research method that eliminates bias in the data itself without modifying additional learning or algorithms, and confirms the potential of the proposed system using COMPAS Data[1], Adult Census Income Data[2] as validation data. © 2022 IEEE.","","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Data acquisition; Data visualization; Face recognition; Web services; Bias problems; Binary classification; Classification datasets; Data collection; Data level; Facial recognition; Fairness problem; Intelligence models; Visualization modules; Webs services; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Ankura; et al.; Hitachi; KPMG Consulting Co., Ltd.; NTT Data Intellilink Corporation; Think in Data Initiative, Association Inc","2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, Big Data 2022","17 December 2022 through 20 December 2022","Osaka","186390","","978-166548045-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147936290"

It is important to support users in analyzing this data, making this process easier and more transparent, especially for users with little (or no) literacy. In this work, we define an inefficient graphics indicator, that is, with the potential to be misinterpreted or difficult to understand, according to the basic guidelines of the data visualization area. These guidelines were selected through a literature review, forming a repository of practices that guide good visualization design and provide the indicator assessment items. This proposal can be applied inis necessary because we do not perceive the existence of standards, norms or quality indicators for data visualization that assist in the creation of this artifact efficiently or evaluate the existing ones for improvement, both manually and automatically. This approach can be applied in the most diverse scenarios, being initially in Brazil during the dissemination of COVID-19, analyzing the official visualizations and highlighting the failures of several epidemiological perspectives on the pandemic. Through a study with users where volunteers analyzed the official data and our recommendations, we demonstrated that the indicator is effective in detecting and helping to understand the visualization.

Previous research has focused on visualization through the generation of graphs, packaging into electronic books, and model highlighting. The research presented in this paper focuses instead on a visual programming approach, commonly applied in the building industry, where design assets and external references are wrapped into visual components and managed on a canvas with information input/output relations displayed. This entails additional documentation efforts, but the visualization is arguably more useful as groups and levels of granularity are adjusted by the engineers themselves as a part of the development work. To explore visual programming and its potential benefits as a way of enabling transparency with adjustable granularity of DA systems within mechanical manufacturing industry, an existing textual design automation system was transformed into a visual one using Grasshopper® (a visual programming environment) and discussed with respect to DA system transparency, feature-based CAD, and DA system development. © ICED 2021.All right reserved.","Design automation; Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM); Knowledge management; Visual programming; Visualisation","3D printers; Additives; Automation; Computer aided design; Computer programming; Construction industry; Knowledge management; Transparency; Automation systems; Building industry; Design automations; Design for additive manufacturing; Electronic books; Electronic model; Forms of representation; Mechanical manufacturing industries; Multiple disciplines; Visual programming; Visualization","Cambridge University Press","","23rd International Conference on Engineering Design, ICED 2021","16 August 2021 through 20 August 2021","Gothenburg","172546","2732527X","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117766091"

This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threaten the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are also reported.  © 2020 IEEE.","bias correction; bias mitigation; cohort selection; high-dimensional visualization; medical informatics; Selection bias","Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Electronics industry; Clickstream data; Computational approach; Electronic health record; Grouping operations; High dimensional data; Large scale data; Medical domains; Visualization designs; article; decision making; interview; retrospective study; selection bias; validity; workflow; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100428278"

As reported by several studies, these data can contain biases, stereotypes and other properties which are transferred also to the machine learning models, potentially leading them to a discriminatory behaviour which should be identified and corrected. A very intuitive technique for bias identification in NLP models is the visualization of word embeddings. Exploiting the concept of that a short distance between two word vectors means a semantic similarity between these two words; for instance, a closeness between the terms nurse and woman could be an indicator of gender bias in the model. These techniques however were designed for static word embedding algorithms such as Word2Vec. Instead, BERT does not guarantee the same relation between semantic similarity and short distance, making the visualization techniques more difficult to apply. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised approach, which only requires a list of gendered words that can be easily found in online lexical resources, for visualizing the gender bias present in the English base model of BERT. Our approach is based on a Linear Support Vector Classifier and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and obtains better results with respect to standard PCA. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The exploration of the data in the tool is performed at various levels of detail, from visualizing the model output itself with its weights to visualizing the aggregation of the results by categories.

The I4.0 concept refers to trends and principles attributed to the 4th industrial revolution and, in particular, assumes the following capabilities of automated systems: Interoperability, decentralization, real-time processing, and service-orientation. Generally, effective forecast evaluation requires us to store both actuals and forecasts. We look at how to handle rolling-origin forecasts produced for many series over multiple horizons. This setup is met both in research (e.g., in forecasting competitions or when proposing a new method) and in practice (when tracking/reporting forecasting performance). We show how to ensure access to all the variables required for exploratory analysis and performance measurement. We propose flexible yet simple and effective data schemas allowing the storage and exchange of actuals, forecasts, and any additional relevant info. We show how to construct various tools for forecast exploration and evaluation using the schemas proposed. In particular, we present our implementation of a prediction-realization diagram showing forecasts from different methods on one plot. We propose special tools for measuring the quality of point and interval rolling-origin predictions across many time series and over multiple horizons.

In this context, the concept of smart cities is discussed. An enabling element of the smart city concept is applying information technology (IT) to improve administrative efficiency and quality of life while reducing costs and resource consumption and ensuring greater citizen participation in administrative and urban development issues. While these smart city services are technologically studied and implemented, government officials, citizens or businesses are often unaware of the large variety of smart city service solutions. Therefore, this work deals with developing a smart city services catalogue that documents best practice services to create a platform that brings citizens, city government, and businesses together. Although the concept of IT service catalogues is not new and guidelines and recommendations for the design and development of service catalogues already exist in the corporate context, there is little work on smart city service catalogues. Therefore, approaches from agile software development and pattern research were adapted to develop the smart city service catalogue platform in this work. © 2021 International Conference on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing 2021, CGVCVIP 2021, Connected Smart Cities 2021, CSC 2021 and Big Data Analytics, Data Mining and Computational Intelligence 2021, BIGDACI 2021 - Held at the 15th Multi-Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2021.

Interestingly, only in recent years these topics have reached importance within Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a whole, under the umbrella of the term XAI (eXplainable AI). Some authors have shown that advances in XAI from different fields (computer science, design, HCI, IR, AI, etc.) have not been properly integrated into a common body of knowledge due to lack of connection among these communities. This talk gives one small step to bridge this gap, by showing how works on explainability, transparency, visualization, user interfaces and user control in recommender systems are significantly related to XAI and can inspire new ideas of research on visual XAI. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

This behavior makes them hard to be applied in real scenarios. To reduce the language biases, previous studies mainly integrate modules to overcome language priors (ensemble-based methods) or generate additional training data to balance dataset biases (data-balanced methods). However, all the existing ensemble-based methods drop their accuracies on the VQA v2 dataset, while data-balanced methods may introduce new biases and cannot guarantee the quality of the generated data. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic training scheme called Suppressing Biased Samples (SBS) to overcome language priors. SBS consists of two collaborative parts, i.e., a Data Classifier Module to divide the dataset into biased samples and unbiased samples by utilizing the similarity in the semantic space, and a Bias Penalty Module to suppress the biased samples to weaken their influence. As a new way of balancing data to address language bias, SBS overcomes the shortcomings of previous data-balanced methods. Experimental results show that our method can be merged into other bias-reduction methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the commonly used VQA-CP v2 dataset. © 1999-2012 IEEE.","Language Bias; Language Priors; Robust VQA; Visual Question Answering","Classification (of information); Computer vision; Data mining; Data visualization; Semantics; Visual languages; Visualization; Annotation; Bias reduction; Ensemble-based method; Image color analysis; Question Answering; Question-answer pairs; Reduction method; Semantic Space; Training data; Training schemes; Hazardous materials spills","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15209210","","ITMUF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110847827"

We conduct two studies of news article visual appearance. The first was with 31 undergraduates who rated the credibility of synthetic newslike articles containing only “lorem ipsum” text, indistinct videos and images, non-functional hyperlinks, and various fonts. The second study was with 30 different university students who rated the credibility of news articles from popular web outlets, half credible and half not. The articles were presented at 5600 words per minute, or 20 times faster than typical reading speeds, enabling only judgments of appearance, not substance. Findings show that credibility is affected by article length, image count and density, and font face and size. These factors interact to yield differential effects on perceived credibility. Articles that struck a balance among factors were most credible, giving rise to the notion of a “Goldilocks zone”, where credibility is highest. Interviews from both studies also revealed that perceived credibility was highest for articles that struck a balance among factors.

Decision makers can now have some certainty in otherwise uncertain situations. However, given what we know about humans and the data analysis and decision making process, is this certainty illusory? Data does not present and analyze itself – humans make judgement calls around sampling, measurement, algorithms, and confidence. Human decision-makers have biases, ideological commitments, and social amplification tendencies. Finally, technical solutions are subject to a variety of tradeoffs and diminishing returns on technical adjustments. We identify sources of uncertainty throughout the data analysis process and illustrate them through the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a pragmatic, sociotechnical approach data-driven decision making in emergent situations that accounts for these sources of uncertainty. This approach involves four principles: defensibility, the restless dialectic, deadliest enemy, and design without final goals.

Binary classifiers have a range of well-known measures to summarise performance, but characterising the performance of multinomial classifiers (systems that classify instances into one of many classes) is an open problem. While confusion matrices can summarise the empirical performance of multinomial classifiers, they are challenging to interpret at a glance—challenges compounded when classes are imbalanced. We present a way to decompose multinomial confusion matrices into components that represent the prior and posterior probabilities of correctly classifying each class, and the intrinsic ability of the classifier to discriminate each class: the Bayes factor or likelihood ratio of a positive (or negative) outcome. This approach uses the odds formulation of Bayes’ rule and leads to compact, informative visualisations of confusion matrices, able to accommodate far more classes than existing methods. We call this method confusR and demonstrate its utility on 2-, 17-, and 379-class confusion matrices. We describe how confusR could be used in the formative assessment of classification systems, investigation of algorithmic fairness, and algorithmic auditing. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Auditing; Classification; Fairness; Multiclass; Performance; Visualisation","Classification (of information); Image resolution; Algorithmics; Binary classifiers; Classification system; Confusion matrix; Design and evaluations; Fairness; Imbalanced class; Multiclass; Multinomials; Performance; Visualization","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","19th Australasian Conference on Data Mining, AusDM 2021","14 December 2021 through 15 December 2021","Virtual, Online","269799","18650929","978-981168530-9","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121898308"

However, discovering biases against different intersectional groups remains a challenging task. In this work, we present WordBias, an interactive visual tool designed to explore biases against intersectional groups encoded in static word embeddings. Given a pretrained static word embedding, WordBias computes the association of each word along different groups like race, age, etc. and then visualizes them using a novel interactive interface. Using a case study, we demonstrate how WordBias can help uncover biases against intersectional groups like Black Muslim Males, Poor Females, etc. encoded in word embedding.

Within-the-bar bias describes a misinterpretation of the distribution of data underlying bar graphs that indicate an average or where the average estimation point moves inside the bar when the average of several graphs is estimated. This study proposes and tests two methods based on information processing to reduce within-the-bar bias. The first method facilitates bottom-up processing by changing various graph features, such as presenting confidence intervals, placing boundaries around the graph, and showing cumulative bars with different tones. The second method facilitates top-down processing by instructing participants to estimate the mean based on a dot at the end of each bar.

Nevertheless, media outlets are often biased. One way to bias news articles is by altering the word choice. The automatic identification of bias by word choice is challenging, primarily due to the lack of gold-standard data sets and high context dependencies. In this research project, I aim to devise data sets and methods to identify media bias. To achieve this, I plan to research methods using natural language processing and deep learning while employing models and using analysis concepts from psychology and linguistics. The first results indicate the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary research approach. My vision is to devise a system that helps news readers become aware of media coverage differences caused by bias. So far, my best performing BERT-based model is pre-trained on a larger corpus consisting of distant labels, indicating that distant supervision has the potential to become a solution for the difficult task of bias detection. © 2021 IEEE.","Information Retrieval; Media bias; news analysis; Slanted Coverage","Automation; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Automated detection; Automated visualization; Data set; Media coverage; Medium bias; News analyse; News articles; Public perception; Slanted coverage; Word choices; Natural language processing systems","IEEE Computer Society","Google; IEEE Technical Committee on Intelligent Informatics; School of Computer Science - The University of Auckland; Two Sigma; US National Science Foundation (NSF)","21st IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2021","7 December 2021 through 10 December 2021","Virtual, Online","176562","23759232","978-166542427-1","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125324342"

The danger of cyber-attacks in defence microgrid facilities cannot be neglected nor undermined, due to the severe consequences that they can cause. To this end, this paper presents a cyberattack detection and cyber attack severity calculation toolkit, with the aim to provide an end-to-end solution to the cyberattack detection in defense IoT/microgrid systems. Concretely, in this paper are presented and evaluated the SPEAR Visual Analytics AI Engine and the SPEAR Grid Trusted Module (GTM) of the SPEAR H2020 project. The aim of the Visual Analytics AI Engine is to detect malicious action that intend to harm the microgrid and to assist the security engineer of an infrastructure to easily detect abnormalities and submit security events accordingly, while the GTM is responsible to calculate the severity of each security event and to assigns trust values to the affected assets of the system. The accurate detection of cyber-attacks and the efficient reputation management, are assessed with data from a real smart home infrastructure with an installed nanogrid, after applying a 3-stage attack against the MODBUS/TCP protocol used by some of the core nanogrid devices. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Artificial intelligence; Cyber-attack detection; Fuzzy logic; Microgrids","Automation; Biomedical engineering; Computer crime; Crime; Energy efficiency; Engines; Microgrids; Network security; Visualization; Cyberattack detection; Defence applications; End-to-end solutions; Reputation management; Security engineers; Source of energy; Trust management; Visual analytics; Artificial intelligence","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","17th IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, AIAI 2021, 6th Workshop on 5G-Putting Intelligence to the Network Edge, 5G-PINE 2021, Artificial Intelligence in Biomedical Engineering and Informatics Workshop, AI-BIO 2021, Workshop on Defense Applications of AI, DAAI 2021, Distributed AI for Resource-Constrained Platforms Workshop, DARE 2021, Energy Efficiency and Artificial Intelligence Workshop, EEAI 2021, and 10th Mining Humanistic Data Workshop, MHDW 2021","25 June 2021 through 27 June 2021","Virtual, Online","261789","18684238","978-303079156-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112663850"

Participants decided whether the metadata presented about an email indicated that it was spam or benign. The task was completed with the aid of a ML model. The ML model’s prediction was displayed on every trial. The inclusion of an explanation and, if an explanation was presented, attributes of the explanation were manipulated within subjects: the number of model input features (3, 7) and visualization of feature importance values (graph, table), as was trial type (i.e., hit, false alarm). Overall model accuracy (50% vs 88%) was manipulated between subjects, and user trust in the model was measured as an individual difference metric. Results suggest that a user’s trust in the model had the largest impact on the decision process. The users showed better performance with a more accurate model, but no differences in accuracy based on number of input features or visualization condition. Rather, users were more likely to detect false alarms made by the more accurate model; they were also more likely to comply with a model “miss” when more model explanation was provided. Finally, response times were longer in individuals reporting low model trust, especially when they did not comply with the model’s prediction. Our findings suggest that the factors impacting the efficacy of ML explanations depends, minimally, on the task, the overall model accuracy, the likelihood of different model errors, and user trust. © 2021, National Technology & Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LCC.","Explainable ML; Human decision-making; Spam detection; Trust in automation","Decision making; Errors; Visualization; Accurate modeling; Decision process; Human decision making; Human performance; Individual Differences; Input features; Machine learning models; Spam detection; Machine learning","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in HCI, AI-HCI 2021, Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021","24 July 2021 through 29 July 2021","Virtual, Online","262209","03029743","978-303077771-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112235391"

To alleviate this problem, we introduce PVA-Guards, safeguards people can leave on uncertain intermediate knowledge that needs to be verified, and derive seven PVA-Guards based on previous visualization task taxonomies. PVA-Guards provide a means of ensuring the correctness of the conclusion and understanding the reason when intermediate knowledge becomes invalid. We also present ProReveal, a proof-of-concept system designed and developed to integrate the seven safeguards into progressive data exploration. Finally, we report a user study with 14 participants, which shows people voluntarily employed PVA-Guards to safeguard their findings and ProReveal's PVA-Guard view provides an overview of uncertain intermediate knowledge.

Data-dependent behavior causes risks in ML systems. Dealing with such risks in the development phase requires non-trivial costs due to un-controllable data generation processes in the test phase. In addition, ML systems often need continuous monitoring and validation in run-time. In this paper, we propose an integrated dependency tracking system that balances the cost and risks in the development stage and operation stage.

The provenance of data and models provides a trustworthy trace for dependencies between datasets and models at the development phase, and predictions at the operation phase.

Use of various machine and deep learning approaches to analyse ECG data has yielded promising results in the field of predictive and diagnostic healthcare with less human error or bias. In our study, 10sec of 500Hz, 12-lead ECG samples were collected from the healthcare workers, who were involved directly or indirectly in taking care of COVID-19 patients. The present study was designed to determine whether Healthcare workers were stressed by using only ECG as input to a deep learning model. To the best of our knowledge, no earlier ECG based study has been carried out to identify stressed persons among the healthcare workers who are giving support to COVID-19 patients. In this study, ECG data of healthcare workers giving services to COVID-19 patients is utilized. This data was collected from four tertiary academic care centres of India. A modified version of AlexNet is utilized on this data that is able to identify a stressed healthcare worker with 99.397% accuracy and 99.411% AUC score.

These are the high-speed fluid dynamic processes, and their study involves obtaining and analyzing large amounts of visual data. For the non-isothermal mixing of an impinging water jet, the flow is analyzed in the region near an IR-transparent wall. The thermograms of non-isothermal vortex flow in the near-wall region are presented. The energy spectra of temperature pulsations are computed for various regions of the wall-jet flow. In the gas-dynamic experiment, the thermal response of the shock tube wall to the shock wave propagation is studied. The infrared imaging of surfaces with different thermal conductivity and emissivity is conducted. The approaches are discussed for optimizing the registration and analysis of large thermographic datasets. © 2020 National Research Nuclear University.

Due to possible perceptual uniformity issues in HSV, a method based on CAM02-UCS color space has been recently proposed. In this user study, the perceptual uniformity and nonlinear bias of the encoding of the degree of polarization parameter into the chromatic magnitude color channel is modeled by a power-law relationship between stimulus scale level and is estimated from responses to paired 2-alternative forced choice questions using Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling. Estimated exponent and noise parameters for these methods are compared for same-hue and different-hue conditions to determine whether the chromatic magnitude channel can be used to orthogonality encode data parameters independently from the hue channel. Overall, the HSV condition displayed more nonuniformity, more nonlinear bias, and more non-orthogonality than the UCS condition. The results here indicate a lower bound for differences between methods since the intensity was chosen for the 'best case' of HSV. These results further support the claim that the chromatic magnitude color channel of a uniform color space can be used to encode a data parameter independently of the hue channel in a multivariate colormapping visualization.  © 2013 IEEE.","color; data visualization; optical polarization; Polarimetry; psychometric testing; user centered design; visualization","Color; Encoding (symbols); Maximum likelihood; Parameter estimation; Polarimeters; Polarization; Visualization; Angle of polarization; Color channels; Condition; Degree of polarization; Imaging data; Nonlinear bias; Orthogonalization; Polarimetric imaging; Psychometric testing; User study; Data visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85125748018"

Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental shortcuts). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Bias mitigation; Decision making; Human bias; Visual data analysis","Bias; Computer Graphics; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Male; Sexism; Behavioral research; Data visualization; Digital storage; Job analysis; Visualization; Analysis process; Bias mitigation; Decisions makings; Human bias; Interaction history; Scatter plots; Task analysis; User interaction; Visual data analysis; computer graphics; decision making; female; human; male; sexism; statistical bias; Decision making","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117809883"

Yet, existing measures of perceptual precision for data channels (e.g., position, length, orientation, etc.) are based largely on verbal reports of ratio judgments between two values (e.g., [7]). Verbal report conflates multiple sources of error beyond actual visual precision, introducing a ratio computation between these values and a requirement to translate that ratio to a verbal number. Here we observe raw measures of precision by eliminating both ratio computations and verbal reports; we simply ask participants to reproduce marks (a single bar or dot) to match a previously seen one. We manipulated whether the mark was initially presented (and later drawn) alone, paired with a reference (e.g. a second '100%' bar also present at test, or a y-axis for the dot), or integrated with the reference (merging that reference bar into a stacked bar graph, or placing the dot directly on the axis). Reproductions of smaller values were overestimated, and larger values were underestimated, suggesting systematic memory biases. Average reproduction error was around 10% of the actual value, regardless of whether the reproduction was done on a common baseline with the original. In the reference and (especially) the integrated conditions, responses were repulsed from an implicit midpoint of the reference mark, such that values above 50% were overestimated, and values below 50% were underestimated. This reproduction paradigm may serve within a new suite of more fundamental measures of the precision of graphical perception.  © 2020 IEEE.","Cognition and perception; Graphical perception; Perceptual biases; Ratio perception","Cell proliferation; Bar graphs; Data channels; Data reproduction; Graphical perceptions; Large parts; Memory bias; Multiple source; Reproduction errors; adult; article; female; human; human experiment; male; memory bias; perception; reproduction; verbal behavior; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097928711"

A term of ethical AI has emerged, and numerous national, European and global guidelines have recently been published, in the hope of creating a unified framework set to be used and implemented across EU and the globe. However, a highly convoluted nature of legislative procedures regarding emerging technologies makes it increasingly complicated to map out ethical AI properties and guidelines. Hence, a holistic and data-driven approach towards AI policy-making is proposed. In order to help EU policymakers and lawmakers, ethical AI principles of explainability and autonomy will be contextualized and visualized. Data contextualization is achieved using secondary datasets based on the systematic literature review, while data visualization is implemented in a form of a compact digital dashboard, using Python programming language and its associated visualization libraries. Goal of the suggested comprehensive solution is to simplify and streamline future decision processes regarding AI topics exclusively from policymakers' perspective. This will indeed shape Europe's digital future and foster trustworthy strategic leadership regarding AI technologies, which is likely to make EU lead by example and become a globally adopted practice.  © 2021 IEEE.","Autonomy; Data Visualization; Ethical Artificial Intelligence; European Union; Explainability; Trustworthy Machine Learning","Data visualization; Digital libraries; Ethical technology; Global system for mobile communications; Machine learning; Autonomy; Context visualization; Decision process; Ethical artificial intelligence; European union; Explainability; Machine-learning; Policy makers; Policy making; Trustworthy machine learning; Visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","14th CMI International Conference - Critical ICT Infrastructures and Platforms, CMI 2021","25 November 2021 through 26 November 2021","Copenhagen","176251","","978-166541645-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124706138"

As such, algorithm developers need tools that can help them uncover potential biases in their models while also exploring the impacts of correcting for biases when employing fairness-aware algorithms. In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms.

Given such scores, individuals with similar scores may or may not attain similar outcomes independent of the individuals’ memberships in the subpopulation. The traditional graphical methods for visualizing inequities are known as “reliability diagrams” or “calibrations plots,” which bin the scores into a partition of all possible values, and for each bin plot both the average outcomes for only individuals in the subpopulation as well as the average outcomes for all individuals; comparing the graph for the subpopulation with that for the full population gives some sense of how the averages for the subpopulation deviate from the averages for the full population. Unfortunately, real data sets contain only finitely many observations, limiting the usable resolution of the bins, and so the conventional methods can obscure important variations due to the binning. Fortunately, plotting cumulative deviation of the subpopulation from the full population as proposed in this paper sidesteps the problematic coarse binning. The cumulative plots encode subpopulation deviation directly as the slopes of secant lines for the graphs. Slope is easy to perceive even when the constant offsets of the secant lines are irrelevant. The cumulative approach avoids binning that smooths over deviations of the subpopulation from the full population. Such cumulative aggregation furnishes both high-resolution graphical methods and simple scalar summary statistics (analogous to those of Kuiper and of Kolmogorov and Smirnov used in statistical significance testing for comparing probability distributions). © 2021, The Author(s).","Calibration; Differences; Fairness; Forecast; Histogram; Prediction; Probabilistic; Statistical; Stochastic; Visualization","Computational complexity; Graphic methods; Population statistics; Probability distributions; Difference; Fairness; Forecast; Graphical methods; Histogram; Matchings; Probabilistics; Similar individuals; Statistical; Stochastics; Stochastic systems","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21961115","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113549829"

However, much of the existing research uses it as an analyzing tool rather than an inductive bias for policy learning. In this work, we use visual attention as an inductive bias for RL agents. We propose a novel self-supervised attention learning approach which can 1. learn to select regions of interest without explicit annotations, and 2. act as a plug for existing deep RL methods to improve the learning performance. We empirically show that the self-supervised attention-aware deep RL methods outperform the baselines in the context of both the rate of convergence and performance. Furthermore, the proposed self-supervised attention is not tied with specific policies, nor restricted to a specific scene. We posit that the proposed approach is a general self-supervised attention module for multi-task learning and transfer learning, and empirically validate the generalization ability of the proposed method. Finally, we show that our method learns meaningful object keypoints highlighting improvements both qualitatively and quantitatively.

The edges in a scanned point cloud usually describe the complex 3D structure of the target object and the surrounding scene. The recently proposed deep learning-based edge upsampling network can generate new points in the edge regions. When combined with the edge-highlighted transparent visualization method, this network can effectively improve the visibility of the edge regions in 3D-scanned point clouds. However, most previous upsampling experiments were performed on the sharp-edge regions despite that 3D-scanned objects usually contain both sharp and soft edge regions. In this paper, to demonstrate the performance of the upsampling network on soft-edge regions, we add more polygon models that contain soft edges by adjusting the models in the training set so that the network can learn more features of soft-edge regions. Additionally, we apply the upsampling network to real 3D-scanned point cloud data that contain numerous soft edges to verify that the edge upsampling network is equally effective at the upsampling task on soft-edge regions. The experimental results show that the visibility of the complex 3D-scanned objects can be effectively improved by increasing the point density in the soft-edge regions. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","3D-scanned point cloud; Point upsampling; Transparent visualization","Complex networks; Deep learning; Signal sampling; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3d-scanned point cloud; 3D-scanning; Complex objects; Edge region; Large-scales; Point upsampling; Point-clouds; Scanning data; Transparent visualization; Upsampling; Visibility","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","20th Asian Simulation Conference, AsiaSim 2021","17 November 2021 through 20 November 2021","Virtual, Online","284909","18650929","978-981196856-3","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141750205"

However, its potential to build a biased view of the information contents is often neglected. Moreover, narrative understanding and emotion may interfere with data visualization comprehension. In this research, we evaluated how users perceived the information in two different configurations: One with a report with graphs and narrative side notes texts, and the second with a redesigned fully annotated content. The test compared the two groups in both qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative results were obtained by a survey and statistically analyzed with a T-Test. This indicated that the condescending storytelling approach augmented the perception of the effect signaled by the presented narrative. Also, the qualitative results collected afterward by interview and focus group have shown that, as the readers of narrative models perceived a higher intensity of the effect, they have also expected an even higher result from the selected data. The final analysis of the experiment helped to indicate that ordering, highlights, and semantics have a strong role in how the narrative influences the perception of the reader. © 2021, Sociedade Brasileira de Design da Informacao.

In contrast, East Java Province’s regional government only plays a role in implementing and evaluating policies. The central government previously formulated the Brantas watershed. This research contributes to strengthening the management and institutional arrangement of the central government and local governments that support the realization of good governance of the Brantas watershed.

Yet reproductions of single bars or groups of bars within a graph can be biased. Curiously, some previous work found that this bias resulted in an overestimation of reproduced data values, while other work found an underestimation. Across three empirical studies, we offer an explanation for these conflicting findings: this discrepancy is a consequence of the differing aspect ratios of the tested bar marks. Viewers are biased to remember a bar mark as being more similar to a prototypical square, leading to an overestimation of bars with a wide aspect ratio, and an underestimation of bars with a tall aspect ratio. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the aspect ratio of the bar marks indeed influenced the direction of this bias. Experiment 3 confirmed that this pattern of misestimation bias was present for reproductions from memory, suggesting that this bias may arise when comparing values across sequential displays or views. We describe additional visualization designs that might be prone to this bias beyond bar charts (e.g., Mekko charts and treemaps), and speculate that other visual channels might hold similar biases toward prototypical values. © 2020 IEEE.","area; aspect ratio; bar charts; Memory biases; position estimation","Encoding (symbols); Visualization; Bar chart; Data values; Empirical studies; Encodings; Single bars; Tree-maps; Visual channels; Visualization designs; article; empiricism; memory; reproduction; Aspect ratio","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85099858606"

Notwithstanding its promising nature, however, AI in healthcare embodies certain ethical challenges as well. This research aims to delineate the most influential elements of scientific research on AI ethics in healthcare by conducting bibliometric, social network analysis, and cluster-based content analysis of scientific articles. Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare. Practically, this research will provide a map for policymakers and AI engineers and scientists on what dimensions of AI-based medical interventions require stricter policies and guidelines and robust ethical design and development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Bibliometric analysis; Content analysis; Ethics; Healthcare; Network visualization; Robotics","Artificial Intelligence; Bibliometrics; Delivery of Health Care; Health Facilities; Humans; Morals; Ethical aspects; Intelligent robots; Predictive analytics; Robotics; Bibliometric; Bibliometrics analysis; Cluster-based; Content analysis; Ethical concerns; Network cluster; Network visualization; Scientific articles; Scientific researches; Social Network Analysis; adult; ambient intelligence; content analysis; conversation; ethics; human; medical practice; physician; practice guideline; review; robotics; social network analysis; artificial intelligence; bibliometrics; health care delivery; health care facility; morality; Health care","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00104825","","CBMDA","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85111534377"

Our approach—Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept. Unlike previous approaches, Grad-CAM is applicable to a wide variety of CNN model-families: (1) CNNs with fully-connected layers (e.g.VGG), (2) CNNs used for structured outputs (e.g.captioning), (3) CNNs used in tasks with multi-modal inputs (e.g.visual question answering) or reinforcement learning, all without architectural changes or re-training. We combine Grad-CAM with existing fine-grained visualizations to create a high-resolution class-discriminative visualization, Guided Grad-CAM, and apply it to image classification, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA) models, including ResNet-based architectures. In the context of image classification models, our visualizations (a) lend insights into failure modes of these models (showing that seemingly unreasonable predictions have reasonable explanations), (b) outperform previous methods on the ILSVRC-15 weakly-supervised localization task, (c) are robust to adversarial perturbations, (d) are more faithful to the underlying model, and (e) help achieve model generalization by identifying dataset bias. For image captioning and VQA, our visualizations show that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image. We devise a way to identify important neurons through Grad-CAM and combine it with neuron names (Bau et al. in Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2017) to provide textual explanations for model decisions. Finally, we design and conduct human studies to measure if Grad-CAM explanations help users establish appropriate trust in predictions from deep networks and show that Grad-CAM helps untrained users successfully discern a ‘stronger’ deep network from a ‘weaker’ one even when both make identical predictions.

The application allows museum staff to capture detailed information describing how visitors move around an exhibition and interact with individual exhibits. They can then visualize the results of tracking either on a single mobile device or with multiple mobile devices connected to a large display. The platform uses orthogonal views of the exhibition space for tracking and visualization, with a chess-piece icon to represent visitors during tracking, and curved semi-transparent lines with animated semi-circles to communicate the path and direction of visitor movement. Our visualization is novel in its use of an orthogonal projection for pedestrian tracking and animation to communicate the flow of visitors around the exhibition space, as well as allowing users to dynamically switch between views representing different groups of visitors. The design of our application was informed through an extensive requirements analysis study conducted with Nanjing Museum and evaluated by conducting expert interviews with museum managers who considered that the application allowed for more effective and efficient recording and analysis of visitor tracking data. © 2019 IEEE.","Human-centered computing; Information visualization; Visualization; Visualization application domains","Data visualization; Display devices; Flow visualization; Information systems; Museums; Surveys; Visualization; Human-centered computing; Information visualization; Orthogonal projection; Orthogonal views; Pedestrian tracking; Requirements analysis; Semi-transparent; Visualization application; Exhibitions","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Computer Society Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","12th IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, PacificVis 2019","23 April 2019 through 26 April 2019","Bangkok","150296","21658765","978-153869226-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070697880"

The effective visualization of aortic stent is considered to be critical to ensure the effectiveness and functions of the aortic stent in clinical practice. Volume rendering with ray casting has been used as an effective approach to enable the effective visualization of aortic stent. The volume rendering relies on the transfer function that converts the medical images into optical attributes including color and transparency. This article proposes a new transfer function, namely, the multi-dimensional transfer function, to provide additional transparency value of a voxel. The proposed approach using the additional transparency value effectively assists the distinguishing of tissues that have the same CT value. The transparency values are simultaneously determined by gray threshold and gray change threshold, which can recognize the unnecessary structures such as bones transparent. A series of experimental results demonstrate that the situation of aorta stent of a patient can be directly observed, and the angle of view can be switched arbitrarily. The proposed method provides a new way for the operation of a virtual endoscopy to reach the place of blood vessels that a traditional endoscopy fails to reach.  © 2020 ACM.","Aortic stent visualization; transfer function; virtual endoscopy; volume rendering","Blood vessels; Computerized tomography; Endoscopy; Medical imaging; Stents; Transparency; Visualization; Volume rendering; Cardio-vascular disease; Clinical practices; Effective approaches; ITS applications; Multi dimensional transfer functions; Vascular stenosis; Virtual endoscopy; Volume visualization; Transfer functions","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","15516857","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088975256"

When datasets are unrepresentative, trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to generalise to real world settings. This is particularly problematic for models trained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent a wide range of races, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for driver drowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are unrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional augmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance when tested on other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to build new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different ethnicity groups. Our framework improves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN) for targeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy that groups faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model is failing. A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented ethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are compared with a model trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy. Although developed in the context of driver drowsiness detection, the proposed framework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection task, but can be applied to other applications. © 2013 IEEE.","CNN; GAN; Population bias; visualisation","Deep neural networks; Population statistics; Visualization; Adversarial networks; Augmentation methods; Cultural context; Data augmentation; Driver drowsiness; Population bias; Real world setting; Under-represented; Convolutional neural networks","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082678877"

Information visualizations leverage perception to convey information on data in ways that make their interpretation easier. Unfortunately, many visualizations omit uncertainty or communicate it less than effectively. We devised a novel way, which we call vague visualization, to render uncertainty without converting it in any numerical or symbolic form, and tested the usability and task fitness of these alternative solutions in a user study that involved a panel of lay people (as proxies of potential patients). In so doing, we aimed to understand whether our solutions facilitate (or at least do not hinder) communication and understanding of probabilistic estimates in a medical context, and if one solution is more effective than the others. We observed that three different vague visualizations convey the right sense of risk with respect to chance (50%) of percentage shown, and inspire an interpretation of the magnitude of the percentages that replicates the typical response of decision making under uncertainty condition. We then claim that these methods are effective because they allow for data interpretations that are uncertain (vague), and yet correct and compatible with appropriate decisions and actions.

However, software products do not trust the same CAs and therefore maintain different root stores, each typically containing hundreds of trusted roots capable of issuing 'trusted' certificates for any domain. Incidents with misissued certificates motivated Google to implement and enforce Certificate Transparency (CT). CT logs archive certificates in a public, auditable and appendonly manner. The adoption of CT changed the trust landscape. As a part of this change, CT logs started to maintain their own root lists and log certificates that chain back to one of the trusted roots. In this paper, we present a first characterization of this emerging CT root store landscape, as well as the tool that we developed for data collection, visualization, and analysis of the root stores. As part of our characterization, we compare the logs' root stores and quantify their changes with respect to both each other and the root stores of major software vendors, look at evolving vendor CT policies, and show that root store mismanagement may be linked to log misbehavior. Finally, we present and discuss the results of a survey that we have sent to the log operators participating in Apple's and Google's CT log programs. © 2020 IFIP.","","Data visualization; Network security; Certificate authority; Data collection; Internet security; LOG operators; Software products; Software vendors; Trusted root; Transparency","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2020 IFIP Networking Conference and Workshops, Networking 2020","22 June 2020 through 25 June 2020","Paris","161921","","978-390317628-7","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090042729"

Transparency and accountability have attracted increasing interest to provide more effective system training, better reliability and improved usability. This workshop will provide a venue for exploring issues that arise in designing, developing and evaluating intelligent user interfaces that provide system transparency or explanations of their behavior.

Recent research suggests that cognitive biases, like numerical anchoring, transfers to visual analytics in the form of visual anchoring. However, it is unclear how visualization users can be visually anchored and how the anchors affect decision-making. To investigate, we performed a between-subjects laboratory experiment with 94 participants to analyze the effects of visual anchors and strategy cues using a visual analytics system. The decision-making task was to identify misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions that modified the scenario video (visual anchor) and/or strategy cues provided. Our findings suggest that such interventions affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy. We discuss implications of our results on the forking paths problem and raise concerns on how visualization researchers train users to avoid unintentionally anchoring users and affecting the end result. © 2019 The Eurographis Assoiation and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

However, these algorithms are complex and have trade-offs, notably between prediction accuracy and fairness to population subgroups. This makes it hard for designers to understand algorithms and design products or services in a way that respects users' goals, values, and needs. We proposed a method to help designers and users explore algorithms, visualize their trade-offs, and select algorithms with trade-offs consistent with their goals and needs. We evaluated our method on the problem of predicting criminal defendants' likelihood to re-offend through (i) a large-scale Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment, and (ii) in-depth interviews with domain experts.

Visual analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g.Tens of thousands of distinct codes in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias-when the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort provenance and visualization, including a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are compared against, and visual encoding of cohort 'drift', which indicates where selection bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization, to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus cohort. These techniques are integrated into a medical temporal event sequence visual analytics tool. We present example use cases and report findings from domain expert user interviews. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Cohort selection; High-dimensional visualization; Medical informatics; Selection bias; Visual analytics","Clustering algorithms; Data visualization; Large dataset; Medical informatics; Cohort selection; Electronic health record systems; High dimensional data; High-dimensional; Selection bias; Temporal event sequences; Visual analytics; Visual analytics systems; adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; electronic health record; female; human; interview; male; selection bias; validity; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075638970"

Although maps have historically been a trusted source of information, changes in society (e.g., lower levels of trust in decision makers) and in mapmaking technologies and practices (e.g., anyone can now make their own maps) mean that we need to spend some time thinking about how, when, and why people trust maps and mapmaking processes. This is critically important if we want stakeholders to engage constructively with the information we present in maps, because they are unlikely to do so if they do not trust what they see. Here I outline three questions about trust and maps that I think need research attention. First, how can we focus map readers' attention on the trustworthiness of mapped data, especially if trustworthiness changes as in the case of real-time data sources? Second, does presenting uncertainty information on maps affect the level of trust map readers have in the map, and if so, does trust vary depending on how the uncertainty information is presented? Finally, how does virality affect trust? Are viral maps less trusted? The time and resources required to develop a better understanding of how trust in maps might be changing will be repaid. The world needs good information to guide policy- and decision-making. Well designed maps can help stakeholders to work together to solve problems, but only if they are trusted. © by the author(s).","COVID-19; Mapping; Maps; Trust; Visualization","","University of Maine","","","","","","1948660X","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088781876"

Visualizing these data helps us to understand the complicated internal structure of the human body. Transparent stereoscopic visualization using depth information is a good way to visualize internal body structure. However, the position and depth information often become unclear when three-dimensional data are rendered transparently. In this study, we aimed to understand the structural understanding and correct depth perception in transparent stereoscopic visualization, and examined how depth perception changes by overlaying multiple iso-surfaces on transparently rendered image. The experimental results showed that multiple iso-surfaces improved the accuracy of perceived depth.

This way, the information could be presented closer to operators’ line of sight, without fully obstructing their view. Therefore, excavator operators could acquire the supportive information provided by the machine without diverting their attention from operational areas. To ensure that there is a match between the supportive information and operators’ contextual needs, we conducted four different activities as parts of our design process. Firstly, we looked at four relevant safety guidelines to determine which information is essential to perform safe operations. Secondly, we reviewed all commercially available technologies to discover their suitability in the excavator context. Thirdly, we conducted a design workshop to generate ideas on how the essential information should look like and behave based on the performed operation and the chosen available technology. Fourthly, we interviewed seven excavator operators to test their understanding and obtain their feedback on the proposed visualization concepts. The results indicated that four out of six visualization concepts that we proposed could be understood easily by the operators and we also revised them to better suit the operators’ way of thinking. All the operators also positively perceived this approach, since all of them included at least three visualization concepts to be presented on the windshield. © 2020 by the authors.

While intuitive, the layer stack suffers from problems of scale and organization. Documents with many layers are unwieldy to edit, finding a specific layer is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. This paper presents a click and hover interaction which visualizes the impact of a layer in the context of the full resolution composited image, providing an easier and faster way to identify layers in complex compositions. Through a user study, we find that users prefer to use hover visualizations in all cases, and that in compositions with many overlapping, semi-transparent layers, users are able to locate layers twice as fast with the click and hover interface. © 2019 Canadian Information Processing Society.

In response, researchers have made efforts to propose and implement fairness measures and algorithms, but those efforts have not been translated to the real-world practice of data-driven decision making. As such, there is still an urgent need to create a viable tool to facilitate fair decision making. We propose FairSight, a visual analytic system to address this need; it is designed to achieve different notions of fairness in ranking decisions through identifying the required actions-understanding, measuring, diagnosing and mitigating biases-that together lead to fairer decision making.

For instance, intelligent systems that plan the exact trajectories of vehicles could increase throughput at intersections, allowing vehicles to pass with high speed and without any need for traffic lights. It is imaginable that C-ITS will manage traffic in fully automated driving (FAD). However, the unpredictable behavior patterns of the automated vehicle (AV) are also likely to make the occupants feel uncomfortable. FAD systems operate based on a vast amount of information. As this information is potentially invisible to individuals, the question is if users trust FAD systems. We hypothesize that users experiencing such scenarios would demand system feedback to anticipate upcoming system decisions and maneuvers. Therefore, we evaluated five augmented reality (AR) user interface (UI) concepts aiming to increase system transparency in a user study (N = 30) in a driving simulation in virtual reality (VR). Our results support the assumption that feedback about the system state (in the form of route information) significantly increases trust in AVs. As trust is highly subjective, we propose to provide experience-based route visualization systems in FAD to meet individuals' needs. © 2019 ACM.","Augmented reality; Fully automated driving; Head-up displays; Human factors; Route indication; Trust","Augmented reality; Automation; Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; User interfaces; Vehicles; Virtual reality; Amount of information; Driving simulation; Exact trajectories; Fully automated; Intelligent transportation systems; Route indication; Route visualization; Trust; Head-up displays","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","8th ACM International Symposium on Pervasive Displays, PerDis 2019","12 June 2019 through 14 June 2019","Palermo","149533","","978-145036751-6","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070694872"

Visualizing these data helps us to understand the complicated internal structure of the human body. Transparent stereoscopic visualization is a good way to visualize the internal body structure with depth information. However, the position and depth information often become unclear when three-dimensional data are rendered transparently. In this study, we examined how depth perception changes by overlaying multiple iso-surfaces on transparently rendered images for structural understanding and correct depth perception in transparent stereoscopic visualization. We tested two types of figures: rectangular and medical data. The experimental results showed that multiple iso-surfaces improved the accuracy of perceived depth. For both figures, it was effective when the opacity of the inner iso-surface was high and the distance between the inner iso-surface and the outer iso-surface was large. In addition, the effect was particularly high when the distance between the inner and the outer iso-surface was large and the size of the inner iso-surface was small. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Depth perception; Medical volumetric data; Multiple iso-surfaces; Transparent stereoscopic visualization","Clustering algorithms; Computerized tomography; Data visualization; Depth perception; Magnetic resonance imaging; Rendering (computer graphics); Stereo image processing; Visualization; Volumetric analysis; Depth information; Imaging technology; Internal structure; Iso surface; Stereoscopic visualization; Structural understanding; Three-dimensional data; Volumetric data; Three dimensional computer graphics","Springer","Advent2 Labs Consultation Pte Ltd; Federation of Asia Simulation Societies; Society of Simulation and Gaming of Singapore; Tezos Southeast Asia","19th Asia Simulation Conference, AsiaSim 2019","30 October 2019 through 1 November 2019","Singapore","233729","18650929","978-981151077-9","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075665059"

Normalization of Hi-C contact map is essential for accurate modeling and interpretation of high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (3C) experiments. Hi-C correction tools were originally developed to normalize systematic biases of karyotypically normal cell lines. However, a vast majority of available Hi-C datasets are derived from cancer cell lines that carry multi-level DNA copy number variations (CNVs). CNV regions display over- or under-representation of interaction frequencies compared to CN-neutral regions. Therefore, it is necessary to remove CNV-driven bias from chromatin interaction data of cancer cell lines to generate a euploid-equivalent contact map. Results: We developed the HiCNAtra framework to compute high-resolution CNV profiles from Hi-C or 3C-seq data of cancer cell lines and to correct chromatin contact maps from systematic biases including CNV-associated bias. First, we introduce a novel ‘entire-fragment’ counting method for better estimation of the read depth (RD) signal from Hi-C reads that recapitulates the whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-derived coverage signal. Second, HiCNAtra employs a multimodal-based hierarchical CNV calling approach, which outperformed OneD and HiNT tools, to accurately identify CNVs of cancer cell lines. Third, incorporating CNV information with other systematic biases, HiCNAtra simultaneously estimates the contribution of each bias and explicitly corrects the interaction matrix using Poisson regression. HiCNAtra normalization abolishes CNV-induced artifacts from the contact map generating a heatmap with homogeneous signal. When benchmarked against OneD, CAIC, and ICE methods using MCF7 cancer cell line, HiCNAtra-corrected heatmap achieves the least 1D signal variation without deforming the inherent chromatin interaction signal. Additionally, HiCNAtra-corrected contact frequencies have minimum correlations with each of the systematic bias sources compared to OneD’s explicit method. Visual inspection of CNV profiles and contact maps of cancer cell lines reveals that HiCNAtra is the most robust Hi-C correction tool for ameliorating CNV-induced bias. Conclusions: HiCNAtra is a Hi-C-based computational tool that provides an analytical and visualization framework for DNA copy number profiling and chromatin contact map correction of karyotypically abnormal cell lines.

Scholars in technical and professional communication have not yet conducted needed empirical research into people's perception and comprehension of data visualizations, especially when part of larger information texts [1]. Our study investigated the extent to which people exaggerated the differences between data points when reading graphs about non-controversial topics that used deceptive techniques and/or exaggerated titles. Participants (n=329) were randomly assigned to view one of four treatments for four different graph types (bar, line, pie, and bubble) and then asked to answer a question about each graph. Results show that deceptive techniques used in the graphs (including truncated axes, 3-D exaggeration, and arbitrary sizing), caused participants to misinterpret information in the deceptive vs. control visualizations for all of the graphs regardless of graph type, previous visualization coursework or comfort level with reading graphs. Results also showed that the presence of exaggerated vs. control titles that accompanied each graph did not significantly influence the extent of the misinterpretation. We will discuss the implication of these findings for technical communication as well as avenues of future research already underway that investigate these topics further. © 2020 ACM.","Data Visualization; Deceptive tactics; Ethics; Graphs; Titles; Truncated Axis","Comfort level; Controversial topics; Data points; Design tactics; Empirical research; Professional communication; Technical communications; Visualization","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group for Design of Communications (SIGDOC)","38th ACM International Conference on Design of Communication, SIGDOC 2020","5 October 2020 through 9 October 2020","Denton, Virtual","163735","","978-145037525-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85094937752"

To investigate the effect of simultaneous color contrast, we conduct two empirical experiments, in both theoretical and application settings, using a set of random target/proximal combinations of colors in the CIEL*a*b* color space. The perception bias of a target color, induced by its surround, is measured. Linear regression analysis indicates that both a high saturation of the proximal color and a high a*/low b* value of the target color cause a strong simultaneous color contrast (i.e., high perception bias). A moderating effect analysis indicates that a* value/b* value of the target color moderates the influence of the saturation of the proximal color on the perception bias. For example, controlling the saturation of the proximal color, the more reddish/yellowish the target color is, the more alleviated the perceptual bias is. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Color perception; Perception bias; Simultaneous color contrast; Visualization","Color vision; Flow visualization; Information systems; Regression analysis; User interfaces; Visualization; Color contrast; Color perception; Empirical experiments; Graphic user interface; Information presentation; Information visualization; Moderating effect; Quantitative information; Color","Springer","","","","","","01782789","","VICOE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067404790"

Note that the challenge is to analyze an amount of data that might be huge (e.g., 1 sample every 15 min for the last, let us say, 4 weeks, for every lightpath in the network) and display charts in seconds, while revealing meaningful information for human operators. The proposed task-oriented visualization tackles such challenge by using charts that first help finding the subset of affected lightpaths thus, reducing the number of lightpaths to be analyzed. In a second step, different charts are used to reduce the element in failure as much as possible. Finally, the few suspicious elements can be analyzed in detail using more traditional timeline graphs. © 2019 IEEE.","Data analysis; Data visualization; Failure localization and optical networks","Data reduction; Data visualization; Fiber optic networks; Visualization; BER degradation; Human operator; Lightpaths; Most likely; Task-oriented; Visualization technique; Visualization tools; Transparent optical networks","IEEE Computer Society","APEX Technologies; CNRS; HV Photonics; Lumomat; Moltech Anjou; Springer","21st International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks, ICTON 2019","9 July 2019 through 13 July 2019","Angers","152064","21627339","978-172812779-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073078415"

Our approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data and it is shown that the normal accuracy is improved by around 50 percent. © 2019 The Author(s) Eurographics Proceedings © 2019 The Eurographics Association.","","Light sources; Visualization; Automatic reconstruction; Bias reduction; Interreflections; Multi-views; Normal maps; Photometric stereo; Real-world; Surface location; Photometry","Eurographics Association","","2019 Conference on Vision, Modeling and Visualization, VMV 2019","30 September 2019 through 2 October 2019","Rostock","160440","","978-303868098-7","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088227138"

This paper investigates the effects of presentation of influence of training data points on machine learning predictions to boost user trust. A framework of fact-checking for boosting user trust is proposed in a predictive decision making scenario to allow users to interactively check the training data points with different influences on the prediction by using parallel coordinates based visualization. This work also investigates the feasibility of physiological signals such as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) as indicators for user trust in predictive decision making. A user study found that the presentation of influences of training data points significantly increases the user trust in predictions, but only for training data points with higher influence values under the high model performance condition, where users can justify their actions with more similar facts to the testing data point. The physiological signal analysis showed that GSR and BVP features correlate to user trust under different influence and model performance conditions. These findings suggest that physiological indicators can be integrated into the user interface of AI applications to automatically communicate user trust variations in predictive decision making. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.","Influence; Machine Learning; Physiological features; Trust","Data mining; Data visualization; Decision making; Electrophysiology; Extraction; Forecasting; Learning systems; Physiological models; User interfaces; Blood volume pulse; Galvanic skin response; Influence; Parallel coordinates; Physiological features; Physiological indicators; Physiological signals; Trust; Machine learning","Springer Verlag","","3rd IFIP Cross Domain Conference for Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction, CD-MAKE 2019","26 August 2019 through 29 August 2019","Canterbury","231589","03029743","978-303029725-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072867572"

Content analysis was conducted on AI R&D guidelines issued by more economically developed countries because they may guide the trend of AI-based applications in education. Specifically, this study consisted of three phases: 1) information retrieval, (2) key term extraction, and (3) data visualization. First, Fisher’s exact test was employed to ensure that different AI R&D guidelines (e.g., the latest ones in the US, EU, Japan, Mainland, and Taiwan) were comparable. Second, the Key Word Extraction System was developed to retrieve essential information in the guidelines. Third, data visualization techniques were performed on key terms across multiple guidelines. A word cloud revealed the similarity among guidelines (e.g., key terms that these guidelines share in common) while a color-coding scheme showed the differences (e.g., occurrence of a key term across guidelines and its frequency within a guideline). Importantly, three key terms, namely, AI, human, and development, are identified as essential commonality across guidelines. As for key terms that only extracted from particular guidelines, interestingly, results with the color-coding scheme suggested that these key terms were weighted differently depends on the developmental emphasis of a nation.

Open learner model (OLM) is a valuable instrument with capability to improve learning that meets such challenges. However, OLMs usually suffer issues concerning interactivity and transparency, which mostly regard the assessment mechanism that is used to evaluate learners’ knowledge. Tackling down transparency issues would offer context for interpreting and comparing learner model information, as well as promoting interactivity. As there is lack of studies investigating the potential of OLMs in educational games, we argue that this work can provide a valuable starting point for applying OLMs or adaptive visualizations of players’ learner models within gameplay sessions, which, in turn, can help to address both issues of application of LA to game research and OLMs. As a case study, we introduce the proposed approach into our adaptive computational thinking game. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive visualization; Educational game; Learning analytics; Open learner model","Transparency; Visualization; Adaptive visualization; Assessment mechanism; Computational thinkings; Educational game; Interactivity; ITS applications; Open learner modeling; Player modeling; Learning systems","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","3rd International Conference on Innovative Technologies and Learning, ICITL 2020","23 November 2020 through 26 November 2020","Porto","252099","03029743","978-303063884-9","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097524691"

Despite the ubiquity of item recommender systems, they can be improved by giving users greater transparency and control. This article develops and assesses interactive strategies for transparency and control, as applied to event sequence recommender systems, which provide guidance in critical life choices such as medical treatments, careers decisions, and educational course selections. This article's main contribution is the use of both record attributes and temporal event information as features to identify similar records and provide appropriate recommendations.While traditional item recommendations are based on choices by people with similar attributes, such as those who looked at this product or watched this movie, our event sequence recommendation approach allows users to select records that share similar attribute values and start with a similar event sequence. Then users see how different choices of actions and the orders and times between them might lead to users' desired outcomes. This paper applies a visual analytics approach to present and explain recommendations of event sequences. It presents a workflow for event sequence recommendation that is implemented in EventAction and reports on three case studies in two domains to illustrate the use of generating event sequence recommendations based on personal histories. It also offers design guidelines for the construction of user interfaces for event sequence recommendation and discusses ethical issues in dealing with personal histories.

Understanding how bias impacts the visual analytic process, how it can be measured, and how its negative effects can be mitigated is a complex problem space. Nonetheless, recent work has begun to approach this problem by proposing theoretical computational metrics that are applied to user interaction sequences to measure bias in real-time. In this paper, we implement and apply these computational metrics in the context of anchoring bias. We present the results of a formative study examining how the metrics can capture anchoring bias in real-time during a visual analytic task.

Moreover, the transformation from traditional infrastructure into smart infrastructure introduces new challenges both from the underdevelopment of information network and the limitation of AI technologies. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the infrastructure system and the current status of the smart infrastructure system based on the framework of closed feedback control loops: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective smart infrastructure system should take into consideration the interaction between the smart infrastructure system and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart response for city emergency, smart environmental protection, and smart humanity, and also study how the smart infrastructure system would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in-depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve the efficiency and safety of city infrastructure through vulnerability-oriented sensing and active monitoring; defining shared responsibilities; communication reinforcements; data visualization; static and dynamic data integration; hierarchical decision making; and optimized and coordinated demand response management. © 2020 IEEE.","automation; modular construction and maintenance; smart agents; ubiquitous real-time guidance and notification","Automation; Control systems; Data acquisition; Data integration; Data visualization; Decision making; Deterioration; Environmental protection; Information services; Materials handling; Rural areas; Smart city; Sustainable development; Urban transportation; Development frameworks; Feedback control loops; Hierarchical decisions; Information networks; Infrastructure systems; Intelligent transportation; Shared responsibility; Smart infrastructures; Information management","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","5th International Conference on Universal Village, UV 2020","24 October 2020 through 27 October 2020","Boston","168944","","978-172819523-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106708388"

HDR is thus often looked at and praised as the next logical step in the evolution of audiovisual entertainment. However, there is no such thing as a single, universal HDR standard, and the competing market projects a future with even more diversity in format specifications, display capabilities and content characteristics. As the competitors attempt to surpass each other and obtain a bigger share of the global market, they inevitably bombard the potential customers and users with brief but effective labels that reflect excellence and superior quality. In this paper, the cognitive effect of such labels is investigated. As home video entertainment is possibly the most numerous instance of the future usage of this visualization technology, video streaming is particularly addressed. Since real-time video transmission services are bound to suffer playback interruptions upon insufficient data rates and uncompensated drops in the available bandwidth, stalling events experienced in conventional multimedia streaming shall apply to HDR video as well. The paper presents four separate experiments, studying how the cognitive bias caused by the labeling effect influences the perception of HDR quality aspects and stalling events, and how the cognitive load varies for stalling detection thresholds between conventional and HDR visualization. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cognitive bias; High dynamic range; Quality of Experience; Video stalling","Bandwidth; Image communication systems; International trade; Multimedia services; Quality of service; Visualization; Cognitive bias; High dynamic range; Multimedia streaming; Potential customers; Quality of experience (QoE); Real-time video transmission; Video stalling; Visualization technologies; Image coding","Springer","","","","","","14355558","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069631629"

However, the inference process of deep learning is black box and is not very suitable to safety-critical systems which must exhibit high transparency. In this paper, to address this black-box limitation, we develop a simple analysis method which consists of (1) structural feature analysis: lists of the features contributing to inference process, (2) linguistic feature analysis: lists of the natural language labels describing the visual attributes for each feature contributing to inference process, and (3) consistency analysis: measuring consistency among input data, inference (label), and the result of our structural and linguistic feature analysis. Our analysis is simplified to reflect the actual inference process for high transparency, whereas it does not include any additional black-box mechanisms such as LSTM for highly human readable results. We conduct experiments and discuss the results of our analysis qualitatively and quantitatively and come to believe that our work improves the transparency of neural networks. Evaluated through 12,800 human tasks, 75% workers answer that input data and result of our feature analysis are consistent, and 70% workers answer that inference (label) and result of our feature analysis are consistent. In addition to the evaluation of the proposed analysis, we find that our analysis also provides suggestions, or possible next actions such as expanding neural network complexity or collecting training data to improve a neural network. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Black box; Deep neural network; Explainable AI; Transparency; Visual attribute; Visualization","Deep neural networks; Flow visualization; Input output programs; Linguistics; Safety engineering; Transparency; Visual languages; Black boxes; Consistency analysis; Learning techniques; Linguistic features; Neural network complexity; Safety critical systems; Structural feature; Visual attributes; Long short-term memory","Springer Verlag","","","","","","21926352","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064455326"

In many real world application domains the numeric predictions of the models drive important and costly decisions. Nevertheless, decision makers frequently require more than a black box model to be able to “trust” the predictions up to the point that they base their decisions on them. In this context, understanding these black boxes has become one of the hot topics in Machine Learning research. This paper proposes a series of visualization tools that explain the relationship between the expected predictive performance of black box regression models and the values of the input variables of any given test case. This type of information thus allows end-users to correctly assess the risks associated with the use of a model, by showing how concrete values of the predictors may affect the performance of the model. Our illustrations with different real world data sets and learning algorithms provide insights on the type of usage and information these tools bring to both the data analyst and the end-user. Furthermore, a thorough evaluation of the proposed tools is performed to showcase the reliability of this approach. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","black box model; error; explainability; performance; regression; transparency","Decision making; Digital storage; Forecasting; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Regression analysis; Risk assessment; Decision makers; Machine learning research; Predictive performance; Regression errors; Regression model; Sophisticated machines; Visual interpretation; Visualization tools; Learning algorithms","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","02664720","","EXSYE","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089374092"

As new unlabelled samples are observed, the machine can either provide a prediction, or query a human ‘oracle’ when the machine is not confident in its prediction. Of course, just as the machine may lack confidence, the same can also be true of a human ‘oracle’: humans are not all-knowing, untiring oracles. A human’s ability to provide an accurate and confident response will often vary between queries, according to the duration of the current interaction, their level of engagement with the system, and the difficulty of the labelling task. This poses an important question of how uncertainty can be expressed and accounted for in a human-machine collaboration. In short, how can we facilitate a mutually-transparent collaboration between two uncertain actors—a person and a machine—that leads to an improved outcome? In this work, we demonstrate the benefit of human-machine collaboration within the process of active learning, where limited data samples are available or where labelling costs are high. To achieve this, we developed a visual analytics tool for active learning that promotes transparency, inspection, understanding and trust, of the learning process through human-machine collaboration. Fundamental to the notion of confidence, both parties can report their level of confidence during active learning tasks using the tool, such that this can be used to inform learning. Human confidence of labels can be accounted for by the machine, the machine can query for samples based on confidence measures, and the machine can report confidence of current predictions to the human, to further the trust and transparency between the collaborative parties. In particular, we find that this can improve the robustness of the classifier when incorrect sample labels are provided, due to unconfidence or fatigue. Reported confidences can also better inform human-machine sample selection in collaborative sampling. Our experimentation compares the impact of different selection strategies for acquiring samples: machine-driven, human-driven, and collaborative selection. We demonstrate how a collaborative approach can improve trust in the model robustness, achieving high accuracy and low user correction, with only limited data sample selections. © 2019, The Author(s).","Active machine learning; Data clustering; Human-machine collaboration; Visual knowledge discovery","Classification (of information); Clustering algorithms; Forecasting; Machine learning; Transparency; Visualization; Active machine learning; Collaborative approach; Confidence Measure; Current interactions; Data clustering; Human centric computing; Human-machine collaboration; Visual knowledge discovery; Man machine systems","Springer Berlin Heidelberg","","","","","","21921962","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061749067"

Transparency and accountability have attracted increasing interest to provide more effective system training, better reliability and improved usability. This workshop will provide a venue for exploring issues that arise in designing, developing and evaluating intelligent user interfaces that provide system transparency or explanations of their behavior.

In this poster, we propose ways of representing the physical obstacles surrounding the user. There are generated from an occupancy map and compared to the representation as a point cloud. We propose three visualisation modes: Integrating an occupancy map into the virtual floor, generating lava lakes where obstacles are and building a semi-transparent wall along the obstacles boundaries. We found that although showing the obstacles on the floor only impacts lightly the navigation, the preferred visualization mode remains the point cloud. © 2019 IEEE.","Centered computing; Centered computing; Empirical studies in visualization; Human; Human; Visualization; Visualization; Visualization techniques","Floors; Flow visualization; Helmet mounted displays; Virtual reality; Visualization; Centered computing; Constraint limits; Empirical studies; Head mounted displays; Human; Semi-transparent; Tracking feature; Visualization technique; User interfaces","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","26th IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, VR 2019","23 March 2019 through 27 March 2019","Osaka","150842","","978-172811377-7","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071891967"

Be it analytical or physics-based models, a cross-cutting challenge for experts is to reliably diagnose which model outcomes appropriately predict or simulate real-world phenomena. Expert judgment involves reconciling information across many, and often, conflicting criteria that describe the quality of model outcomes. In this paper, through a design study with climate scientists, we develop a deeper understanding of the problem and solution space of model diagnostics, resulting in the following contributions: i) a problem and task characterization using which we map experts' model diagnostics goals to multi-way visual comparison tasks, ii) a design space of comparative visual cues for letting experts quickly understand the degree of disagreement among competing models and gauge the degree of stability of model outputs with respect to alternative criteria, and iii) design and evaluation of MyriadCues, an interactive visualization interface for exploring alternative hypotheses and insights about good and bad models by leveraging comparative visual cues.

These communications could be facilitated by new technologies, such as 5G communication, which aim to be faster by providing higher bandwidth guarantees. This higher network capacity will increase exponentially the volume of data that could be extracted from the Internet regarding individual user or entities' behavior and concurrently the number of attacks that could be deployed. Thus, it is becoming increasing challenging to evaluate the trustworthiness of entities on the Internet. The contribution of this paper is a new methodology of aggregating behavior that aids in evaluating individual trust. We introduce a basic methodology for calculating Trust, which is later extended through clustering of malicious events. Based on the proposed methodology, a GUI is implemented that allows the quick and easy visualization of malicious behavior with the corresponding trust calculation. Overall, this work aims to support existing trust models in terms of aggregating behavior and translating it into trustworthiness. © 2019 IEEE.","Behavior; Trust; Visualization","Flow visualization; Visualization; Bandwidth guarantee; Behavior; Higher networks; Malicious behavior; Trust; Trust evaluation; Trust models; 5G mobile communication systems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","24th IEEE International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks, CAMAD 2019","11 September 2019 through 13 September 2019","Limassol","152550","23784873","978-172811016-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073806365"

Although web page credibility has been investigated generally, most work has focused on the credibility of web page content. In this work, we study the isolated appearance of news-like web pages. Specifically, we report on a laboratory experiment involving 31 college students rating the perceived credibility of news-like web pages devoid of meaningful content. These pages contain only “lorem ipsum” text, indistinct videos and images, non-functional links, and various font settings. Our findings show that perceived credibility is indeed affected by some purely presentational factors. Specifically, video presence increased credibility, while large fonts and having no images reduced credibility. Having a few, but not too many, images increased credibility for short articles, especially in the presence of large fonts. We also conducted follow-up interviews, which revealed that participants noticed images, videos, and font sizes when making credibility judgments, corroborating our quantitative experimental results. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Believability; Content; Credibility; Fonts; Images; Online news; Trust; Video; Visual appearance; Visual presentation; Web page","Hypertext systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Websites; Believability; Content; Credibility; Fonts; Images; Online news; Trust; Video; Visual appearance; Visual presentation; Students","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM SIGWEB","30th ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media, HT 2019","17 September 2019 through 20 September 2019","Hof","151930","","978-145036885-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073319773"

As medical imaging techniques become increasingly sophisticated, virtual anatomical education applications have emerged. Still, anatomical models are often preferred, as they facilitate 3D localization of anatomical structures. Recently, data physicalizations (i.e., physical visualizations) have proven to be effective and engaging—sometimes, even more than their virtual counterparts. So far, medical data physicalizations involve mainly 3D printing, which is still expensive and cumbersome. We investigate alternative forms of physicalizations, which use readily available technologies (home printers) and inexpensive materials (paper or semi-transparent films) to generate crafts for anatomical edutainment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer-generated crafting approach within an anatomical edutainment context. Our approach follows a cost-effective, simple, and easy-to-employ workflow, resulting in assemblable data sculptures (i.e., semi-transparent sliceforms). It primarily supports volumetric data (such as CT or MRI), but mesh data can also be imported. An octree slices the imported volume and an optimization step simplifies the slice configuration, proposing the optimal order for easy assembly. A packing algorithm places the resulting slices with their labels, annotations, and assembly instructions on a paper or transparent film of user-selected size, to be printed, assembled into a sliceform, and explored. We conducted two user studies to assess our approach, demonstrating that it is an initial positive step towards the successful creation of interactive and engaging anatomical physicalizations. © 2020 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2020 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

For some data types, greater transparency in data visualization is also associated with an increase in the amount of information depicted. Based on prior work in economics and political science that has identified four dimensions of transparency, we examined the influence of accuracy, clarity, amount of disclosure, and thoroughness on a decision task where participants relied on map-based visualizations with varying complexity to solve a crisis. The results of our preliminary analysis suggest that perceived clarity, amount of disclosure. and thoroughness significantly predicted individuals’ selection of a Google Maps-like application with either less information or more information. Trust and perceived accuracy did not significantly predict which navigation application visualization participants decided to use (i.e., one with more information or less information). Further, our preliminary results suggest that an individual’s ratings of accuracy and disclosure of a visualization predicted their ratings of the trustworthiness of that visualization. We discuss the implications of a possible dissociation between trust and decision tasks on visualization evaluation. In future work, we aim to examine the influence of the amount of information shown in a visualization on ratings of trust and determine the generalizability of our preliminary findings to different task types and visualization approaches. © 2019 The Author(s).","","Data visualization; Transparency; Amount of information; Datatypes; Decision task; Economic science; Four dimensions; Google maps; Perceived trusts; Political science; Preliminary analysis; Task type; Visualization","The Eurographics Association","EUROGRAPHICS Association","1st EuroVis Workshop on Trustworthy Visualization, TrustVis 2019","3 June 2019","Porto","174900","","978-303868091-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088154133"

Indeed, crowdfunding platforms have several advantages (e.g., reducing barriers to bottom up initiatives and democratizing access to high-return investments). Simultaneously, as governments are in their early stage of addressing the many risks and grey areas related to the dynamics of crowdfunding, the accountability of platforms has a crucial role.

Subsequently, the media might frame the results incorrectly. The transparency of ILSA is essential to the advancement of the public discourse. It requires easy access to data together with simple analysis tools. However, the complexity of ILSA makes it hard to understand and to analyze. Open PISA tries to deal with this challenge by developing a dashboard for the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). It aims to guide users in the analysis of the dataset.

To achieve this, the entire item space of a domain is visualized using a map-like interface. Inside, users can express their preferences on which the RS reacts with matching recommendations. To change recommendations, users can alter their preferences expressed, which creates a continuous feedback loop between user and RS.

By using a live-virtual-constructive approach similar to the U.S. military’s synthetic training environments (STE), to intentionally engage a cross-functional team in a pilot to field a prototype CAS-UAS, a co-created CAS-UAS could anticipate and address security and privacy concerns of the sort that slowed the roll-out of police body-worn cameras (BWC) and wide area motion imagery (WAMI), particularly in the context of privacy concerns over the use of facial recognition. The paper is intended to provide communities with a new approach to identify and address policy obstacles to deploying smart city IoT technology to save lives, here in the case of a CAS-UAS that can enhance situational awareness for first responders during active shootings inside of public buildings like shopping malls, corporate headquarters, houses of worship or schools. The paper draws on the author’s personal experience testifying before the U.S. Congress concerning recent questions about the supply chain security of small commercial drones. © 2020 Curran Associates Inc..

It has a significant role in decision-making process by means of evaluation of data visualizations. This paper elaborates on the experimental depiction of two cognitive bias types, namely Distinction Bias and Confirmation Bias, through the examination of cognate visual experimentations. The main goal of this implementation is to indicate the existence of cognitive bias in visual analytics systems through the adjustment of data visualization and crowdsourcing in terms of confirmation and distinction biases. Two distinct surveys that include biased and unbiased data visualizations which are related to a given data set were established in order to detect and measure the level of existence of introduced bias types. Practice of crowdsourcing which is provided by Amazon Mechanical Turk have been used for experimentation purposes through prepared surveys. Results statistically indicate that both distinction and confirmation biases has substantial effect and prominent significance on decision-making process. © 2019 The Author(s).","","Cognitive systems; Crowdsourcing; Decision making; Surveys; Visualization; Amazon's mechanical turks; Cognitive bias; Confirmation bias; Data set; Decision-making process; Human judgments; Visual analytics systems; Data visualization","The Eurographics Association","EUROGRAPHICS Association","1st EuroVis Workshop on Trustworthy Visualization, TrustVis 2019","3 June 2019","Porto","174900","","978-303868091-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088117585"

Not only are other encodings less precise than position, but they can also be prone to systematic biases (e.g., color category boundaries can distort perceived differences between hues). By comparison, position's high level of precision may seem to protect it from such biases. In contrast, across three empirical studies, we show that while position may be a precise form of data encoding, it can also produce systematic biases in how values are visually encoded, at least for reports of average position across a short delay. In displays with a single line or a single set of bars, reports of average positions were significantly biased, such that line positions were underestimated and bar positions were overestimated. In displays with multiple data series (i.e., multiple lines and/or sets of bars), this systematic bias still persisted. We also observed an effect of 'perceptual pull', where the average position estimate for each series was 'pulled' toward the other. These findings suggest that, although position may still be the most precise form of visual data encoding, it can also be systematically biased. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","bar graphs; cue combination; line graphs; perception and cognition; Perceptual biases; position estimation","Encoding (symbols); Graph theory; Signal encoding; Bar graphs; Cue combination; Line graph; Perception and cognition; Perceptual biases; Position estimation; article; empiricism; statistical bias; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85075640221"

As open forms of teaching we used blended learning, open space technology (OST) and selected elements of gamification. Game-based learning approaches posit that learners who interact with educational materials with playful and dynamic tasks will learn better. To better understand improvement of teamwork, social skills and collaboration a specific business game with a defined amount of play tokens is introduced. Within this business game all participants (n = 22) will have to form interdisciplinary project teams to manage a professional 3D-visualization task. In three subsequent project stages (concept, development and implementation) all projects are continually evaluated and the teams are appropriately rewarded with play tokens. With these play tokens every team can purchase missing know-how or hire additional workforce. The final visualization project is evaluated by specific design criteria (qualitative) and by the remaining amount of play tokens (quantitative). The concept of a business game was a visible success. Open forms of teaching, such as blended learning and open space technology promote the active acquisition of basic knowledge, technical understanding and at least increase transfer competence. A continuous and transparent evaluation makes the individual learning progress directly tangible. Students who took part in the business game reported more enjoyment in learning the 3D visualization pipeline than students from the years before. The business game induced greater interest to the students in acquiring new content more easily and quickly than in the other courses. Also their high degree of personal responsibility led to outstanding new ideas and their own initiatives. © 2019 IEEE.","Collaborative learning; Computer games; Game-based learning; Participatory design; Virtual reality","Curricula; Interactive computer graphics; Students; Technology transfer; Three dimensional computer graphics; Virtual reality; Visualization; Collaborative learning; Educational materials; Game-based Learning; Individual learning; Interdisciplinary project; Participatory design; Personal responsibility; Technical understanding; Computer games","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","H2020 iMareCulture; H2020 Terpsichore; H2020 VIMM; HCI Lab at Masaryk University","11th International Conference on Virtual Worlds and Games for Serious Applications, VS-Games 2019","4 September 2019 through 6 September 2019","Vienna","152783","","978-153867123-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074293138"

The intention of the design is to help operators in acquiring supportive information provided by the machine, without requiring them to divert their attention far from operational areas. We started the design process by reviewing mobile crane safety guidelines to determine which information that operators need to know in order to perform safe operations. Using the findings from the safety guidelines review, we then conducted a design workshop to generate design ideas and visualisation concepts, as well as to delineate their appearances and behaviour based on the capability of transparent displays. We transformed the results of the workshop to a low-fidelity paper prototype, and then interviewed six mobile crane operators to obtain their feedback on the proposed concepts. The results of the study indicate that, as information will be presented closer to operators' line of sight, we need to be selective on what kind of information and how much information that should be presented to operators. However, all the operators appreciated having information presented closer to their line of sight, as an approach that has the potential to improve safety in their operations. © 2020 Canadian Information Processing Society.

One way to improve safety is through improved training and flight visualization. The introduction of Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) applications to the flight deck has allowed post-flight visualization and debrief tools to emerge in an attempt to provide pilots with more information about their flights. While we could assume that safety-driven post-flight feedback that alerts pilots to potentially hazardous situations can facilitate risk management in subsequent flights, it is not clear how the way we present feedback affects how pilots perceive it, or what the best way to present it is. In this paper, we develop different ways of presenting pilots with safety-driven information, informed by the literature on risk assessment and cognitive biases, and design a survey to identify potential implications of communicating risk to pilots in different ways. © 2019, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

CBM helps the association of soluble cellulases with insoluble cellulose in cellulosic hydrolysis. We review the visualizations of CBM from three aspects: CBM adsorption to cellulose, CBM occupying space in cellulose and cellulose surface accessibility to CBM. Our review reveals: the most effective crystal faces are 220 and 220 for cellulose; cellulase is more efficient to catalyze the cellulose with at least 50 cellobioses; and a bunch of celluloses can be stratified into not only traditional amorphous and crystalline regions, but also disordered/dislocated region, and each region is subject to a specific type of CBM. Our review implies: cellulases usually approach cellulose through 100, 110 and 010 crystal faces although β-1, 4-glycosidic bond is located near to crystal faces 220 and 220; and it requires the small sized cellulases to access to fragment of cellulose because cellulases appear much larger for cellulose smaller than 50 cellobioses.  © 2020 IEEE.","Carbohydrate binding module; Cellulase; Cellulose; Microscopy; Visualization","Accessibility; Binding; Cellulase; Cellulose; Chemical Bonds; Crystalline Regions; Review; Surfaces; Carbohydrates; Crystals; Fiber optic networks; Transparent optical networks; Visualization; Carbohydrate-binding modules; Catalytic domains; Cellulose surfaces; Crystal face; Crystalline regions; Signal domain; Cellulose","IEEE Computer Society","European Optical Society (EOS) Italian Branch; Societa Italiana di Ottica e Fotonica (SIOF)","22nd International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks, ICTON 2020","19 July 2020 through 23 July 2020","Bari","163275","21627339","978-172818423-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092509072"

As research has shown, such systems are highly susceptible to bias. We propose that this is not only due to their reliance on biased datasets but also because their perceptual topology, their specific way of representing the visual world, gives rise to a new class of bias that we call perceptual bias. Perceptual bias, we argue, affects almost all currently available “off-the-shelf” machine vision systems, and is thus especially relevant for digital humanities applications, which often rely on such systems for hypothesis building. We evaluate the nature and scope of perceptual bias by means of a close reading of a visual analytics technique called “feature visualization” and propose to understand the development of critical visual analytics techniques as an important (digital) humanities challenge, situated at the interface of computer science and visual studies. © 2020 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

But that means that two people can see different patterns in the same visualization, potentially leading to miscommunication. Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that naïve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice. The present findings show that the curse of knowledge also plagues the visual perception of data, explaining why people can fail to connect with audiences when they communicate patterns in data.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Cognitive biases; data communication; expertise; information visualization; perception and cognition","Visualization; Data values; Political events; Visual data; Visual perception; Visual salience; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090250735"

Method & framework: A straightforward questionnaire involving four simple questions regarding specific technical aspects was administered to the surgeons to evaluate their basic judgments on the surgical strategy to follow. Images from a standard CT scan were used for the subsequent processing and 3D printing of a very cheap anatomical model of a surgical scenario with a low-cost printer, which was shared with the surgeons. At last, the same questionnaire was re-administered to the surgeons. The degree of judgment was found to be modified by approximately 25%. Conclusion: From a surgical point of view, the interaction with technical experts seems to add precious information to the clinical pre-surgical scenario for decision making.

Prior work has shown that visualization interpretation can be manipulated through slanted titles that favor only one side of the visual story, yet people still think the visualization is impartial. In this work, we study whether such effects continue to exist when titles and visualizations exhibit greater degrees of misalignment: titles whose message differs from the visually cued message in the visualization, and titles whose message contradicts the visualization. We found that although titles with a contradictory slant triggered more people to identify bias compared to titles with a miscued slant, visualizations were persistently perceived as impartial by the majority. Further, people’s recall of the visualization’s message more frequently aligned with the titles than the visualization. Based on these results, we discuss the potential of leveraging textual components to detect and combat visual-based misinformation with text-based slants. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Confirmation bias; Misinformation; Visualization title","Alignment; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Confirmation bias; Misinformation; Visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGCHI","2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, CHI 2019","4 May 2019 through 9 May 2019","Glasgow","147770","","978-145035970-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067606292"

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) in the USA is the current practice regulation of privacy protection.

Privacy protection method based on clustering is the process of developing methods and algorithm to ensure that the published data remains useful and protected. In this paper, we purposed an algorithm based on greedy clustering to group the data points according to the attributes and the connective information of the nodes in the published social network. During the procedure of clustering, we handled the loss of information, and evaluated the proposed approach in terms of classification accuracy and information loss rates on real medical datasets.

We explored the effects of spatial layout and visual representation in an in-person user study with 33 participants. We measured participants' appropriate trust in the classifier, quantified the effects of different spatial layouts and visual representations, and observed changes in users' trust over time. The results show that each explanation improved users' trust in the classifier, and the combination of explanation, human, and classification algorithm yielded much better decisions than the human and classification algorithm separately. Yet these visual explanations lead to different levels of trust and may cause inappropriate trust if an explanation is difficult to understand. Visual representation and performance feedback strongly affect users' trust, and spatial layout shows a moderate effect. Our results do not support that individual differences (e.g., propensity to trust) affect users' trust in the classifier.

Scientists are challenged in performing efficient and reproducible data extraction and analysis pipelines over heterogeneously processed datasets. Available software packages are suitable for analyzing experimental files from such datasets one by one, but do not scale to thousands of experiments. Moreover, they lack proper support for metadata manipulation. Results: We present PyGMQL, a novel software for the manipulation of region-based genomic files and their relative metadata, built on top of the GMQL genomic big data management system. PyGMQL provides a set of expressive functions for the manipulation of region data and their metadata that can scale to arbitrary clusters and implicitly apply to thousands of files, producing millions of regions. PyGMQL provides data interoperability, distribution transparency and query outsourcing. The PyGMQL package integrates scalable data extraction over the Apache Spark engine underlying the GMQL implementation with native Python support for interactive data analysis and visualization. It supports data interoperability, solving the impedance mismatch between executing set-oriented queries and programming in Python. PyGMQL provides distribution transparency (the ability to address a remote dataset) and query outsourcing (the ability to assign processing to a remote service) in an orthogonal way. Outsourced processing can address cloud-based installations of the GMQL engine. Conclusions: PyGMQL is an effective and innovative tool for supporting tertiary data extraction and analysis pipelines. We demonstrate the expressiveness and performance of PyGMQL through a sequence of biological data analysis scenarios of increasing complexity, which highlight reproducibility, expressive power and scalability. © 2019 The Author(s).","Data scalability; Distribution transparency; Genomic data; Python; Tertiary data analysis","Data Analysis; Databases, Genetic; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Genome; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Transcription Factors; Data handling; Data visualization; Engines; Extraction; Genes; High level languages; Information management; Interoperability; Metadata; Outsourcing; Pipelines; Scalability; Transparency; transcription factor; Data extraction and analysis; Data interoperability; Data management system; Genomic data; Impedance mismatch; Interactive data analysis; Python; Set-oriented queries; article; big data; data analysis; data extraction; data interoperability; impedance; metadata; pipeline; reproducibility; software; enhancer region; genetic database; genetics; genome; genome-wide association study; genomics; human; metabolism; software; Data mining","BioMed Central Ltd.","","","","","","14712105","","BBMIC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074686066"

This paper argues that eliminating bias from visualizations is impossible, efforts to do so have negative real-world consequences for people, and that strategically emphasizing bias in visualizations is not only desirable, but also ethical. The growing public mistrust in science has not been helped by efforts to produce visualizations devoid of bias. This paper further argues that ethical visualization can only be achieved by acknowledging and embracing the treacherous nature of data visualization as a medium, committing to an ethics of care in visualization, investigating the potential for both benefit and harm when visualizing specific data, and then employing strategies to mitigate the harm involved in creating, using, and sharing visualizations. These strategies center around consciously crafting a visual frame (ie bias) for communicating data to a given audience. This paper offers 1) a critical lens on the rhetorical nature of visualizations, 2) the Hippocratic oath as a means of committing to maximizing the benefit, and mitigating the harm, done by visualizations, 3) ethical visualization for impact as a practical strategy for taming treacherous visualizations, and 4) compassionate visualizations as the end goal of following ethical visualization practices. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Care ethics; Compassion; Science communication; Visualization","Data Science; Data visualization; Human computer interaction; Philosophical aspects; User experience; User interfaces; Real-world; Visual frame; Visualization","Springer","","9th International Conference on Design, User Experience, and Usability, DUXU 2020, held as part of the 22nd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2020","19 July 2020 through 24 July 2020","Copenhagen","242289","03029743","978-303049712-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088746261"

The goal is to introduce sophisticated training technologies and to use technological developments to tailor training to Soldier needs. AR/VR technologies have been identified as a low-cost solution to enhance training. However, little is known about the impact of AR/VR technology system reliability as well as how best to use VR for training. Decades of human automation interaction research suggests that technology reliability impacts trust in the system which then impacts SA and task performance. An understanding of how trust in VR interplays with performance outcomes is critical for enhancing Soldier performance with VR technology. Concurrently, individual differences will impact responses to new technologies and should therefore be accounted for in the introduction of new forms of technology and training. Thus there is a need to understand (1) the impact of trust in VR-based training on training objectives, e.g., situational awareness (SA) or performance, given challenges with reliability of the technology, and (2) how to optimize the use of VR given individual differences in trust in technology. Thirty-six participants volunteered and participated in a single factor three level within subjects design tactical mission simulation.

To provide an overview and present the frontiers of current research on the topic, we present a State-of-the-Art Report (STAR) on enhancing trust in ML models with the use of interactive visualization. We define and describe the background of the topic, introduce a categorization for visualization techniques that aim to accomplish this goal, and discuss insights and opportunities for future research directions. Among our contributions is a categorization of trust against different facets of interactive ML, expanded and improved from previous research.

Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups. Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups. We present FAIRVIS, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models. Through FAIRVIS, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups. FAIRVIS's coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups. We show how FAIRVIS helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism. As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FAIRVIS demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems. © 2019 IEEE.","intersectional bias; Machine learning fairness; subgroup discovery; visual analytics","Data visualization; Graphical user interfaces; Visualization; Coordinated views; Interactive visualizations; intersectional bias; Machine learning models; Real world domain; Subgroup discovery; Visual analytics; Visual analytics systems; Machine learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","14th IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology, VAST 2019","20 October 2019 through 25 October 2019","Vancouver","157617","","978-172812284-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077989810"

The current work analyzed these online reviews by sentiment analysis and used the extracted sentiments as features to predict the product ratings by several machine learning algorithms. These predictions were disentangled by various methods of explainable AI (XAI) to understand whether the model showed any bias during prediction. Study 1 benchmarked these algorithms (knn, support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, XGBoost) and identified random forests and XGBoost as best algorithms for predicting the product ratings. In Study 2, the analysis of global feature importance identified the sentiment joy and the emotional valence negative as most predictive features. Two XAI visualization methods, local feature attributions and partial dependency plots, revealed several incorrect prediction mechanisms on the instance-level. Performing the benchmarking as classification, Study 3 identified a high no-information rate of 64.4% that indicated high class imbalance as underlying reason for the identified problems. In conclusion, good performance by machine learning algorithms must be taken with caution because the dataset, as encountered in this work, could be biased towards certain predictions. This work demonstrates how XAI methods reveal such prediction bias. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Bias detection; Explainable AI; Interpretable AI; Product reviews; Sentiment analysis","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Human computer interaction; Random forests; Sentiment analysis; Support vector machines; Emotional valences; Global feature; Gradient boosting; Information rates; Online product reviews; Prediction mechanisms; Product ratings; Visualization method; Learning systems","Springer","","1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in HCI, AI-HCI 2020, held as part of the 22nd International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCII 2020","19 July 2020 through 24 July 2020","Copenhagen","242489","03029743","978-303050333-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088744902"

However, because of lack of transparency, they are not able to explain the data in a human-friendly form. In this paper, Cumulative Fuzzy Class Membership Criterion (CFCMC), a recently proposed fuzzy modeling classifier, is modified and utilized for a novel approach of information extraction from the labeled data. This approach is able to explain the classifiability of the data in the form of semantics. Extracted semantics give information about the structure of the data and the similarities between classes. To get a relevant image of its classification performance, it is compared to three well-known and frequently used classifiers, which are considered as black boxes, namely, SVM, MLP, and kNN, and to a similar transparent approach, MF ARTMAP. To validate extracted semantics, they are compared to visualization of classified data and to confusion matrices generated during the evaluation of the created CFCMC models. The experimental result shows that CFCMC is not necessarily the best classifier, although, in most cases, it is not too far from the best performing methods. However, the semantical explanation potentially allows the classifier to be applied as a support for human decision processes in real-world problems. © 2019 The Author(s).","explainable machine learning; Semantic extraction; support for human-decision; transparent fuzzy classifier","Classifiers; Data mining; Data visualization; Fuzzy sets; Machine learning; Semantics; Support vector machines; Classification performance; Confusion matrices; Fuzzy classifiers; Fuzzy modeling; Human decisions; Human-friendly; Real-world problem; Semantic extraction; Classification (of information)","World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, studies that empirically test this assumption are scarce. Using the Information Systems (IS) Success Model as a theoretical basis, this study aims to examine the effects of data quality, system quality, and service quality on citizens' trust in OGD. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the 200 responses to our online questionnaire. We found that trust in OGD can be predicted by citizens' perceptions of OGD system quality and service quality. Furthermore, citizens' perception of service quality positively influences their perceptions of data and system quality, whereas citizens' perception of system quality positively influences their perception of data quality. This study is among the first that quantitatively examines the effects of data quality, service quality, and system quality on citizen's trust in OGD. It contributes to the scientific literature by providing an operationalization of elements of the IS Success Model in the context of OGD and by developing and applying a model of factors influencing citizen's trust in OGD. While previous research finds that perceived data quality is the most crucial driver for trust in OGD, our study finds that citizens' perception of OGD service quality is a more important driver for trust in OGD. With regard to the practical contributions of this study, open data policymakers should be aware that citizens' perceptions on data quality can be greatly improved when appropriate human services are provided (e.g., designated civil servants offering support or help to data users) in addition to the provision of OGD portal functionalities (e.g., data visualization and comparison tools). © 2020 ACM.","Citizen engagement; Data quality; Information Systems Success Model; Open Government Data; Service quality; Structural Equation Modeling; Systems quality; Trust","Data reduction; Data visualization; Government data processing; Information use; Quality of service; Civil servants; Information systems success models; IS success model; Online questionnaire; Scientific literature; Service Quality; Structural equation modeling; System quality; Open Data","Association for Computing Machinery","","21st Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research: Intelligent Government in the Intelligent Information Society, DGO 2020","15 June 2020 through 19 June 2020","Seoul","161151","","978-145038791-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086895343"

Thus, the current paper first turns an eye towards identifying some potential pitfalls in emotion visualization which could lead to psychological or physical harm, miscommunication, and disempowerment. Then, some countermeasures are proposed and discussed - including some level of control over what is visualized and provision of suitably rich emotional information comprising intentions - toward facilitating a future in which emotion visualization could contribute toward people's well-being. The scenarios presented here are not limited to web technologies, since one typically thinks about emotion recognition primarily in the context of direct contact. However, as interfaces develop beyond today's keyboard and monitor, more information becomes available also at a distance - for example, speech-to-text software could evolve to annotate any dictated text with a speaker's emotional state. © 2018 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 License.","affective computing; black mirror; emotion visualization; ethics; intention recognition; privacy","Visual communication; Visualization; World Wide Web; Affective Computing; Direct contact; Emotion recognition; Emotional information; Emotional state; Science fictions; Television shows; Web technologies; Interface states","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Amazon; Baidu; et al.; Google; IDEX Lyon; Inria","27th International World Wide Web, WWW 2018","23 April 2018 through 27 April 2018","Lyon","159682","","978-145035640-4","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079709702"

As we interact with complex intelligent artefacts, humans inevitably construct mental models to understand and predict their behaviour. If these models are incorrect or inadequate, we run the risk of self deception or even harm. Here we demonstrate that providing even a simple, abstracted real-Time visualisation of a robot's AI can radically improve the transparency of machine cognition. Findings from both an online experiment using a video recording of a robot, and from direct observation of a robot show substantial improvements in observers' understanding of the robot's behaviour. Unexpectedly, this improved understanding was correlated in one condition with an increased perception that the robot was 'thinking', but in no conditions was the robot's assessed intelligence impacted.

But does high familiarity drive better analytical judgment? This question is especially relevant when familiar methods themselves can have shortcomings: many visualizations used conventionally for scientific data analysis and presentation do not follow established best practices. This necessitates new methods that might be unfamiliar yet prove to be more effective. But there is little empirical understanding of the relationships between scientists' subjective impressions about familiar and unfamiliar visualizations and objective measures of their visual analytic judgments. To address this gap and to study these factors, we focus on visualizations used for comparison of climate model performance.

The perceptual bias when estimating relative values displayed by a visual sign may weaken the accuracy and cause misjudgment. This research explores the heuristic estimation of relative values using visual cues, namely linear, areal, and volumetric information.We conduct experiments to empirically test the influences of dimensional information on perceptual biases. First, we investigate the conspicuity of areal information. Our experiments indicate that the responses of participants instructed to estimate rates defined by either linear or volumetric information are biased by the corresponding rates determined by areal information. Second, visual cues implying three-dimensional information (e.g., depth) can lead to overestimation. Third, we probe the influence of vividness as the boundary condition on relative value estimation. Empirical evidence on perceptual bias sheds light on the pragmatics of visual signs, helps suggest guidelines for visual persuasions, and improves decision-making quality.","Dimensional information; Information visualization; Perceptual bias; Relative value estimation; Visual cue","Information systems; Semantics; Dimensional information; Information visualization; Perceptual bias; Relative value; Visual cue; Decision making","Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","15443558","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017268001"

We examine whether this cognitive bias, so far only tested with three alternatives and simple presentation formats such as numerical tables, text and pictures, also appears in visualizations. Since visualizations can be used to support decision making - e.g., when choosing a house to buy or an employee to hire - a systematic bias could have important implications. In a first crowdsource experiment, we indeed partially replicated the attraction effect with three alternatives presented as a numerical table, and observed similar effects when they were presented as a scatterplot. In a second experiment, we investigated if the effect extends to larger sets of alternatives, where the number of alternatives is too large for numerical tables to be practical. Our findings indicate that the bias persists for larger sets of alternatives presented as scatterplots. We discuss implications for future research on how to further study and possibly alleviate the attraction effect. © 2016 IEEE.","asymmetric dominance effect; attraction effect; cognitive bias; decision-making; decoy effect; Information visualization","Information analysis; Information science; Information systems; Visualization; asymmetric dominance effect; attraction effect; Cognitive bias; decoy effect; Information visualization; article; cognitive bias; employee; human; human experiment; Decision making","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84998679059"

In volume rendering, sliced medical images are transformed into attributes, such as color and opacity through transfer function. Thus, the design of the transfer function directly affects the result of medical images visualization. A well-designed transfer function can improve both the image quality and visualization speed. In one of our previous paper, we designed a multi-dimensional transfer function based on region growth to determine the transparency of a voxel, where both gray threshold and gray change threshold are used to calculate the transparency. In this paper, a new approach of the transfer function is proposed based on clustering analysis of gray-gradient mode histogram, where volume data is represented in a two-dimensional histogram. Clustering analysis is carried out based on the spatial information of volume data in the histogram, and the transfer function is automatically generated by means of clustering analysis of the spatial information. The dataset of human thoracic is used in our experiment to evaluate the performance of volume rendering using the proposed transfer function. By comparing with the original transfer function implemented in two popularly used volume rendering systems, visualization toolkit (VTK) and RadiAnt DICOM Viewer, the effectiveness and performance of the proposed transfer function are demonstrated in terms of the rendering efficiency and image quality, where more accurate and clearer features are presented rather than a blur red area. Furthermore, the complex operations on the two-dimensional histogram are avoided in our proposed approach and more detailed information can be seen from our final visualized image. © 2013 IEEE.","clustering analysis; Gray-gradient mode histogram; transfer function; volume rendering","Cluster analysis; Image enhancement; Image quality; Medical imaging; Transparency; Visualization; Volume rendering; Automatically generated; Clustering analysis; Complex operations; Gray-gradient mode histogram; Multi dimensional transfer functions; Spatial informations; Two-dimensional histogram; Visualization toolkits; Transfer functions","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068986763"

Unfortunately, these circumstances are often complex and ambiguous, complicating decision making tasks. One common decision making error, called confirmation bias, occurs when decision makers prematurely focus on one explanation instead of systematically considering all plausible alternative explanations that could equally well account for an operational anomaly (Nickerson, 1998) [1]. The Delphi display is designed to counteract decision makers' tendencies towards confirmation bias and to encourage them to consider all plausible explanations, including high risk explanations, they might otherwise overlook. An initial Delphi display prototype was designed to help identify the underlying cause of operational anomalies in the complex, high-consequence technology of deepwater drilling. This prototype decision aid incorporates major indicators related to operational anomalies and presents corresponding plausible explanations for each indicator, ranging from high-risk system-critical explanations to lower-risk but still significant events. The Delphi display incorporates several innovative features to help decision makers detect and monitor operational anomalies and view the relationships among indicators and their associated plausible explanations. Preliminary evaluations of an early prototype Delphi display for detecting kicks in deepwater oil drilling operations have been promising. Moreover, the methodology used to design and develop the Delphi display can be readily generalized to numerous other operational contexts that require humans to make system-critical decisions. To illustrate, an initial Delphi display design for nuclear power plant control is described. © 2017 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC.

However, how such social information embedded in a visualization impacts a viewer's interpretation of the data remains unknown. Inspired by recent interactive visualizations that display people's expectations of data against the data, we conducted a controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of showing social information in the form of other people's expectations on people's ability to recall the data, the degree to which they adjust their expectations to align with the data, and their trust in the accuracy of the data. We found that social information that exhibits a high degree of consensus lead participants to recall the data more accurately relative to participants who were exposed to the data alone. Additionally, participants trusted the accuracy of the data less and were more likely to maintain their initial expectations when other people's expectations aligned with their own initial expectations but not with the data. We conclude by characterizing the design space for visualizing others' expectations alongside data. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Data interpretation; Social influence; Social visualization","Computer Graphics; Crowdsourcing; Data Visualization; Databases, Factual; Humans; Mental Recall; Motivation; Social Perception; Trust; Data reduction; Economic and social effects; Focusing; Social aspects; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Collaboration; Data interpretation; Market researches; Social influence; Social network services; Social visualization; Uncertainty; computer graphics; crowdsourcing; factual database; human; motivation; perception; recall; trust; Data visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028716517"

Current and future variations in color bit depth, peak brightness, black level and all other characteristics of display and content ultimately lead to a fine-grained market of end-user products with a multitude of different capabilities and also numerous quality standards. Such identifiers and indicators may influence the Quality of Experience (QoE), as they create expectations and preconceptions regarding visual quality. In fact, sometimes even a single word may fundamentally affect user experience. In this paper, we investigate the labeling effect on HDR video QoE. We carried out a series of subjective tests where test participants compared unimpaired HDR videos. The trigger of the labeling effect was that one of the stimuli in the paired comparison was identified as Premium HDR. In order to gain more insight into the biased perception and experience, subjective assessment was separately performed for the different quality aspects of HDR visualization, such as luminance or color. © 2018 IEEE.","Cognitive bias; High Dynamic Range; labeling effect; Quality of Experience","Luminance; Multimedia services; Visualization; Cognitive bias; De facto standard; High dynamic range; Labeling effects; Paired comparison; Quality of experience (QoE); Subjective assessments; Visual qualities; Quality of service","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","2018 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops, ICMEW 2018","23 July 2018 through 27 July 2018","San Diego","143072","","978-153864195-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059984160"

As meaningful data are likely to be high dimensional, visualizing them requires dimensional reduction algorithms, which objective is to map high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while preserving some of their underlying structures. For labeled data, their low-dimensional representations should embed their classifiability so that their class-structures become visible. It is also beneficial if an algorithm can classify labeled input while at the same time executes dimensional reduction to visually offer information regarding the data’s structure to give rational behind the classification. However, most of the currently available dimensional reduction methods are not usually equipped with classification features, while most classification algorithm lacks transparencies in rationalizing their decisions. In this paper, the restricted radial basis function networks (rRBF), a recently proposed supervised neural network with low-dimensional internal representation, is utilized for visualizing high-dimensional data while also performing classification. The primary focus of this paper is to empirically explain the classifiability and visual transparency of the rRBF. © 2016, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Dimensional reduction; Learning representation; Self-organizing map; Supervised learning","Clustering algorithms; Conformal mapping; Data mining; Data reduction; Data visualization; Functions; Radial basis function networks; Self organizing maps; Supervised learning; Transparency; Classification algorithm; Classification features; Dimensional reduction; Internal representation; Learning representation; Low-dimensional representation; Supervised neural networks; Three dimensional space; Classification (of information)","Springer London","","","","","","09410643","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85000501041"

An important but unsolved problem is how exactly the model parameters are related to the properties of the perceived transparent layer. We previously proposed a parametrization in terms of hue, saturation, overall transmittance and clarity of the filter that seems to capture important dimensions of the phenomenal impressions. However, these parameters are not independent and the corresponding scales are not perceptually uniform. Here, an invertible transformation of this parameter space is proposed that strongly mitigates these problems. This results in a more intuitively interpretable parameter set that seems well suited for the analysis of existing stimuli and the generation of transparent overlays with predefined perceptual properties.

With the advent of a new era of high-speed telecommunication services, mobile users have evolved to a large extent demanding secure, private, and trustworthy services. Online social networks have evolved as pervasive online social networks (POSNs), which uses a common platform to connect users from hybrid applications. Trust has always been a concern for these networks. However, existing approaches tend to provide application-specific trust management, thus resulting in the cost of excessive network resource utilization and high computations. In this paper, a pervasive trust management framework is presented for POSNs, which is capable of generating high trust value between the users with a lower cost of monitoring. The proposed approach uses a flexible mixture model to develop the system around six different properties, and then utilizes the concept of osmotic computing to perform computational offloading, which reduces the number of computations as well as computational time. The novel concepts of lock door policy and intermediate state management procedure are used to allow trust visualization by providing efficient identification of trustworthy and untrustworthy users. The proposed approach is capable of predicting user ratings efficiently with extremely low errors, which are in the range of ±2. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using theoretical and numerical analyses along with data set-based simulations. © 2017 IEEE.","online social networks; osmotic computing; Pervasive social networks; trust management; trust visualization","Osmosis; Social sciences computing; Telecommunication services; Visualization; Application specific; High-speed telecommunications; Network resource utilization; On-line social networks; osmotic computing; Pervasive social networkings; Social communications; Trust management; Social networking (online)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","21693536","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85021842143"

Criminal analysts often use visual analytics environments for their analysis of large data sets, for gaining insights on criminal events and patterns of criminal events, and for drawing conclusions and making decisions. However, due to the nature of human cognition, these cognitive processes may lead to systematic errors, so-called cognitive biases. The most prominent and relevant cognitive bias in the intelligence field is the confirmation bias, in which an analyst disproportionally considers and selects information that supports the initial expectation and hypothesis. The framework presented in this paper describes a model, how the possible occurence of the confirmation bias can be detected automatically, while the analyst makes use of the visual environment. Moreover, based on this information, different feedback methods are employed that support and encourage the mitigation of the confirmation bias. This framework is in a work-in-progress state and contains research objectives and directions, the framework design, initial implementations, plans for further development and integration, as well as user-centric evaluation. © 2016 IEEE.","Cognitive bias; Criminal intelligence; Visual analytics","Crime; Systematic errors; Visualization; Cognitive bias; Cognitive process; Criminal analysis; Criminal intelligence; Research objectives; User-centric evaluations; Visual analytics; Visual environments; Network function virtualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Royal Institute of Technology (KTH); Uppsala University","7th European Intelligence and Security Informatics Conference, EISIC 2016","17 August 2016 through 19 August 2016","Uppsala","126764","","978-150902856-6","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017270151"

Initially, associate enterprise were created and then renamed as cooperatives. The fundamental difference between publicly accountable enterprises (PAE) and cooperatives are the former is incorporated with an intention of investor-owned public companies where capital is raised in the form of share-issues to public at large. However, cooperatives do not normally raise capital from public except are formed by group of members' and more often keep a low-profile compare to PAE. Indeed, according to Accounting Standard Board (AcSB), where an entity perform business activities and manages financial resources entrusted to it by clients, customers or group of members who are outsiders of the business operations, and do not involved in the enterprise's business activities and also in its operations, for instance enterprises like certain cooperatives are required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as PAE for fiscal year beginning January 1 2011 or earlier - it is a Status Quo and not an option.

We investigate this question in the context of chronic disease self-management with the focus on type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods We conducted an observational qualitative study of discovery with personal data among adults attending a diabetes self-management education (DSME) program that utilized a discovery-based curriculum. The study included observations of class sessions, and interviews and focus groups with the educator and attendees of the program (n = 14). Results The main discovery in diabetes self-management evolved around discovering patterns of association between characteristics of individuals’ activities and changes in their blood glucose levels that the participants referred to as “cause and effect”. This discovery empowered individuals to actively engage in self-management and provided a desired flexibility in selection of personalized self-management strategies. We show that discovery of cause and effect involves four essential phases: (1) feature selection, (2) hypothesis generation, (3) feature evaluation, and (4) goal specification. Further, we identify opportunities to support discovery at each stage with informatics and data visualization solutions by providing assistance with: (1) active manipulation of collected data (e.g., grouping, filtering and side-by-side inspection), (2) hypotheses formulation (e.g., using natural language statements or constructing visual queries), (3) inference evaluation (e.g., through aggregation and visual comparison, and statistical analysis of associations), and (4) translation of discoveries into actionable goals (e.g., tailored selection from computable knowledge sources of effective diabetes self-management behaviors). Discussion The study suggests that discovery of cause and effect in diabetes can be a powerful approach to helping individuals to improve their self-management strategies, and that self-monitoring data can serve as a driving engine for personal discovery that may lead to sustainable behavior changes.

It provides a useful tool for the patients and trainees and enables a more comprehensive understanding of the inner structure. Computer graphics (CG) is commonly used for medical data visualization. The stereoscopic effect of the CG data can be perceived using a stereoscopic display. However, for complex shape data, it is difficult to perceive and handle the spatial information correctly. In this study, we carried out experiments to investigate how to correctly arrange and visualize transparent slices in transparent volume data using a multi-view autostereoscopic display. We expect that correct position of the slices can be correctly perceived by visualizing contour lines of the slices which were arranged at regular intervals along the line of sight.

The procedure of this research consists of three steps. The first step reviews a theoretical framework of visual management with control theory. The second step develops the image of digital visual management through comparing that of conventional visual management. And the third step discusses the possibility of the extension of visual management by digital innovation based on the framework described in the first and second steps. As the result, this paper focuses on three capabilities of visual management, non-ordinariness, inducibility, and timeliness, and indicates the finding of each capability as follows. For the first capability, the design of robust digital visual network is important to detect the both of internal and external risks which dramatically increase in a production activities with globalization and social responsibility. For the second capability, attractive and advanced visual tools can enlarge the power of expression of existing tools such as posters, signs, and warnings and contribute to the improvement of visualization quality to overcome limitations of perception. For the third capability, on the other hand, visual management has a possibility of the above benefits from digital innovation, the digitalized system may have two latent troubles that are ‘the waste of visualization’ and ‘the omission of visualization’. That is the reason why it is considered hard to frequently improve full specification of the system once the system is established. These findings will be regarded as a compass to digitalize visual management by academic and practical sides in the future. © 2018, Curran Associates Inc.

In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decision-making. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users' interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.Index Terms: K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]: Project and People Management-Life Cycle, K.7.m [The Computing Profession]: Miscellaneous-Ethics. © 2017 IEEE.","Anchoring Effect; Cognitive Bias; Interaction Log Analysis; Sense Making; Visual Analytics","Behavioral research; Information management; Life cycle; Visualization; Anchoring effects; Anchorings; Cognitive bias; Decisions makings; Human decision-making; Interaction log analyse; Log analysis; Making decision; Sense making; Visual analytics; Decision making","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology, VAST 2017","1 October 2017 through 6 October 2017","Phoenix","143983","","978-153863163-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058584767"

The process of mapping the VN requests onto the physical substrate network is called Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem. The use of EONs in network virtualization brings in an additional requirement of satisfying the spectrum-continuity and sub-carrier consecutiveness constraints. In transparent VNE (t-VNE), all the virtual links from a VN request must be mapped to the substrate links with the same set of sub-carriers. This makes t-VNE even more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel t-VNE algorithm called Alignment and Consecutiveness-aware Transparent Virtual Network Embedding (ACT-VNE), which takes into account the spectrum alignment and consecutiveness between adjacent fiber links when mapping virtual nodes onto the physical substrate nodes. We also introduce an extended scheme, namely, Importance, Alignment and Consecutiveness-aware Transparent Virtual Network Embedding (iACTs-VNE) that assigns virtual nodes to substrate nodes within close proximity to establish connections with less bandwidth utilization. Simulation results show that ACT-VNE and iACT-VNE yield a lower blocking probability than existing schemes. When comparing iACT-VNE with ACT-VNE, the former requires less average substrate path length and yields lower link utilization ratio but offers better blocking performance than the latter. © 2016 IEEE.","","Alignment; Blocking probability; Computer supported cooperative work; Distributed computer systems; Fiber optic networks; Mapping; Band-width utilization; Blocking performance; Elastic optical networks; Link utilization; Network visualization; Substrate networks; Virtual network embedding; Virtual networks; Transparent optical networks","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","et al.; IEEE; IEEE Communications Society; IEEE Princeton / Central Jersey Section; IEEE Region 1; MTT-S","37th IEEE Sarnoff Symposium, Sarnoff 2016","19 September 2016 through 21 September 2016","Newark","126406","","978-150901540-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85015190063"

Interactive data visualization can play a critical role in allowing domain experts to select and analyze data from these large collections. However, there is a critical mismatch between the very large number of dimensions in complex real-world datasets and the much smaller number of dimensions that can be concurrently visualized using modern techniques. This gap in dimensionality can result in high levels of selection bias that go unnoticed by users. The bias can in turn threaten the very validity of any subsequent insights. This article describes Adaptive Contextualization (AC), a novel approach to interactive visual data selection that is specifically designed to combat the invisible introduction of selection bias. The AC approach (1) monitors and models a user's visual data selection activity, (2) computes metrics over that model to quantify the amount of selection bias after each step, (3) visualizes the metric results, and (4) provides interactive tools that help users assess and avoid bias-related problems.

Concerning the unclear relationship between transparency and accountability, this case study first develops the conception of accountability in the context of open government and finds that accountability relates to the organizational need for an assessment of policy goals. This paper then examines the process in which a state health agency implements data visualization tools in an attempt to enhance the outcome of its open data policy goals. Drawing on the results from semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of internal users at the state agency, this case study provides some evidence as to how the gap between transparency and accountability can be closed at the organizational level. It also finds that data intermediaries can help government agencies overcome their resource constraints by critically assessing data usability while providing the technological expertise to align their open data policy goals with user expectations. Future research is necessary to examine the role of data intermediaries in wider open data ecosystems including multiple external stakeholders. © 2017 ACM.","Accountability; Data intermediaries; Health data; Open data; Open data ecosystem; Transparency; Visualization","Ecology; Ecosystems; Flow visualization; Health; Public policy; Transparency; Visualization; Accountability; Data intermediaries; Data visualization tools; External stakeholders; Health data; Open datum; Organizational levels; Semi structured interviews; Data visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","City University of New York (CUNY)/School of Business at College of Staten Island (CSI); Emerald Publishing Group; IOS Press; iSecure Lab at College of Staten Island (CSI); Journal of Informatics; Rutgers University I-DSLA institute","18th Annual International Conference on Digital Government Research, DG.O 2017","7 June 2017 through 9 June 2017","Staten Island","128275","","978-145035317-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023617572"

The acquired point clouds are large-scale and precisely record complex 3D internal structures of the scanned objects. Visualization quality of such point clouds highly depends on density distributional uniformity, that is, the uniformity of the inter-point distances. The visualization quality can be improved by making point distances uniform. In addition, the visibility further improves by emphasizing edges. In this study, first the uniformity and flexible tuning of the point density based on Poisson disk sampling are examined. The resultant high-quality point clouds are then applied to transparent visualization.

Although in many situations, it would be very important for the 3D structures of the visualized transparent images to be perceived as they are simulated, little is known quantitatively as to how such transparent 3D structures are perceived. To address this question, in the present study, we conducted a psychophysical experiment in which the observers reported the perceived depth magnitude of a transparent object in medical images, presented with a multi-view 3D display. For the visualization, we employed a stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) method, which was developed recently as a technique for efficient transparent-rendering. Perceived depth of the transparent object was smaller than the simulated depth. We found, however, that such depth underestimation can be alleviated to some extent by (1) applying luminance gradient inherent in the SPBR method, (2) employing high opacities, and (3) introducing binocular disparity and motion parallax produced by a multi-view 3D display. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","automultiscopic 3D image; psychophysics; Transparent visualization","Geometrical optics; Medical imaging; Rendering (computer graphics); Stochastic systems; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3-D image; Binocular disparity; Important object; Point-based rendering; Psychophysical experiments; psychophysics; Quantitative evaluation; Transparent objects; Three dimensional displays","World Scientific Publishing Co.

On the other hand, it is known that stereoscopic vision is effective in allowing us to intuitively understand 3D shapes and to realize natural depth feel of visualized scenes. It is expected that the combination of these two visualization techniques, that is, transparent viewing and the stereoscopic vision, namely transparent stereoscopic visualization, should be effective for our easier and intuitive understanding of inner structures of 3D objects. However, the cognitive effects that arise when combining these two techniques have not been fully understood for us until now. In this paper, we investigate the cognitive effects that arise when combining these two techniques of computer visualization. We specially focus on medical volume visualization to investigate influences of the luminance gradient, which is inherent in the stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) that we proposed recently. We conducted psychophysical experiments in which observers analysed the perceived 3D structure based on transparent stereoscopic visualization. The experiments are executed under the conditions of monocular, binocular viewing and motion parallax. We found that the luminance gradient is effective in the perceived depth magnitude in the transparent stereoscopic viewing of medical volume data. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Automultiscopic 3D image; Depth perception; Transparent visualization","Depth perception; Geometrical optics; Health care; Luminance; Medical applications; Stereo image processing; Stochastic systems; Visualization; 3-D image; Computer visualization; Intuitive understanding; Medical volume visualization; Point-based rendering; Psychophysical experiments; Stereoscopic visualization; Visualization technique; Three dimensional computer graphics","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","5th KES International Conference on Innovation in Medicine and Healthcare, InMed-17 2017","21 June 2017 through 23 June 2017","Algarve","192179","21903018","978-331959396-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019726472"

The objective of ex post transparency enhancing tools (TETs) is to provide users with insight about what data have been processed about them and what possible consequences might arise after their data have been revealed, that is, ex post. This survey assesses the state of the art in scientific literature of the usability of ex post TETs enhancing privacy and discusses them in terms of their common features and unique characteristics. The article first defines the scope of usable transparency in terms of relevant privacy principles for providing transparency by taking the GDPR as a point of reference, and usability principles that are important for achieving transparency. These principles for usable transparency serve as a reference for classifying and assessing the surveyed TETs. The retrieval and screening process of the publications is then described, as is the process for deriving the subsequent classification of the characteristics of the TETs. The survey not only looks into what is made transparent by the TETs but also how transparency is actually achieved. A main contribution of this survey is a proposed classification that assesses the TETs based on their functionality, implementation and evaluation as described in the literature. It concludes by discussing the trends and limitations of the surveyed TETs in regard to the defined scope of usable TETs and shows possible directions of future research for addressing these gaps.

However, the inherent high variability in both encoded video and network rates represents a key challenge for designing efficient adaptation algorithms. Accommodating such variability in the adaptation logic design is essential for achieving a high user quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we present ARBITER+ as a novel adaptation algorithm for DASH. ARBITER+ integrates different components that are designed to ensure a high video QoE while accommodating inherent system variabilities. These components include a tunable adaptive target rate estimator, hybrid throughput sampling, controlled switching, and short-term actual video rate tracking. We extensively evaluate the streaming performance using real video and cellular network traces. We show that ARBITER+ components work in harmony to balance temporal and visual QoE aspects. Additionally, we show that ARBITER+ enjoys a noticeable QoE margin in comparison to state-of-the-art adaptation approaches in various operating conditions. Furthermore, we show that ARBITER+ also achieves the best application-level fairness when a group of mobile video clients shares a cellular base station. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive video streaming; DASH; fairness; quality of experience (QoE); throughput estimation; throughput sampling; wireless networks","Estimation; Flow visualization; HTTP; Media streaming; Mobile telecommunication systems; Throughput; Video recording; Wireless networks; Adaptive video streaming; DASH; fairness; Quality assessment; Quality of experience (QoE); Streaming media; Quality of service","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15361233","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045298887"

Using a custom-built visual analytic system, we presented users with news content from social media accounts from a variety of news outlets, including outlets engaged in distributing misinformation. We conducted controlled experiments to study decision-making regarding the veracity of these news outlets and tested the role of confirmation bias (the tendency to ignore contradicting information) and uncertainty of information on human decision-making processes. Our findings reveal that the presence of conflicting information, presented to users in the form of cues, impacts the ability to judge the veracity of news in systematic ways. We also find that even instructing participants to explicitly disconfirm given hypotheses does not significantly impact their decision-making regarding misinformation when compared to a control condition. Our findings have the potential to inform the design of visual analytics systems so that they may be used to mitigate the effects of cognitive biases and stymie the spread of misinformation on social media.

Drivers who have always been in complete control of their car are expected to willingly hand over control and blindly trust a technology that could kill them. We argue that trust in autonomous driving can be increased by means of a driver interface that visualizes the car's interpretation of the current situation and its corresponding actions. To verify this, we compared different visualizations in a user study, overlaid to a driving scene: (1) a chauffeur avatar, (2) a world in miniature, and (3) a display of the car's indicators as the baseline. The world in miniature visualization increased trust the most. The human-like chauffeur avatar can also increase trust, however, we did not find a significant difference between the chauffeur and the baseline. © 2017 ACM.","Anthropomorphism; Automated driving; Avatar; Trust; Trustworthiness","Visualization; Anthropomorphism; Automated driving; Avatar; Trust; Trustworthiness; User interfaces","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGAI; ACM SIGCHI","22nd International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, IUI 2017","13 March 2017 through 16 March 2017","Limassol","126745","","978-145034348-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85016490867"

A key benefit of DVR is that semi-transparency can be facilitated in order to convey the complexity of the visualized data. Unfortunately, semi-transparency introduces new challenges in spatial comprehension of the visualized data, as the ambiguities inherent to semi-transparent representations affect spatial comprehension. Accordingly, many visualization techniques have been introduced to enhance the spatial comprehension of DVR images. In this paper, we conduct a user evaluation in which we compare standard DVR with five visualization techniques which have been proposed to enhance the spatial comprehension of DVR images. In our study, we investigate the perceptual performance of these techniques and compare them against each other to find out which technique is most suitable for different types of data and purposes. In order to do this, a large-scale user study was conducted with 300 participants who completed a number of micro-tasks designed such that the aggregated feedback gives us insight on how well these techniques aid the end user to perceive depth and shape of objects.

Most at-risk regions are too small or lack the resources and human capital to implement any of the standard set of strategies such as expanding the creative class, industry cluster-based growth strategies or industry diversification. The regions that succeed – the survivors – are often held up as role models, but those who struggled and didn’t make it to the top may provide clues as to what is needed for success. We examine the worse performing U.S. counties to ascertain their similarities and differences. Using county employment growth from 2001 to 2016 as the measure of performance, we assessed a set of county characteristics across: 1) industry structure, 2) occupational structure, 3) social capital and demographic data and 4) innovation measures. We conducted several quintile regressions and found few robust and insight-enhancing results. We posit that the methods and even the variable selection process itself may suffer from survivorship bias. Different approaches are needed. We propose using visualizations to discover patterns of regional characteristics to develop a regional narrative. At-risk counties are different in different ways. This points to the need to conduct a case study of each specific county, with a set of the feasible policy options for that county as the starting point.

Most language models are trained on a large amount of dataset and difficult to be adapted to other domains which may have only a small dataset available. Tuning discounting parameters for smoothing is one way to adapt language models for a new domain. In this work, we present novel language models based on tunable discounting mechanisms. The language models are trained on a large dataset, but their discounting parameters can be tuned to a target dataset afterwards. We explore tunable discounting and polynomial discounting functions based on the modified Kneser–Ney (mKN) models. Specifically, we propose the tunable mKN (TmKN) model, polymomial discounting mKN (PmKN) model, and tunable and polynomial discounting mKN (TPmKN) model. We test our proposed models and compared with the mKN model, improved KN model, and the tunable mKN with the interpolation model (mKN + interp). With the implementation, our language models achieve perplexity improvements in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our new models significantly outperform the baseline model and our models are especially suitable for adapting to new domains. In addition, we use the visualization technique to depict the relationship between parameter settings and the language model performances for guiding our parameter optimization process. The exploratory visual analysis is then used to examine the performance of the proposed language models which will reveal the strength and characteristic of the models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Domain adaptation; Language model; Polynomial discounting; Tunable discounting; Visualization","Computational linguistics; Flow visualization; Natural language processing systems; Polynomials; Visualization; Domain adaptation; Language model; Parameter optimization; Parameter setting; Tunable discounting; Visual analysis; Visual exploration; Visualization technique; Article; cognitive bias; controlled study; data analysis; exploratory research; language model; natural language processing; polynomial discounting; priority journal; process optimization; statistical analysis; statistical parameters; tunable discounting; Visual languages","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09252312","","NRCGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020908038"

Given the weather and soil properties, farmers need to take critical decisions such as which seed variety to plant and in what proportion, in order to maximize productivity. These decisions are irreversible and any unusual behavior of external factors, such as weather, can have catastrophic impact on the productivity of crop. A variety which is highly desirable to a farmer might be unavailable or in short supply, therefore, it is very critical to evaluate which variety or varieties are more likely to be chosen by farmers from a growing region in order to meet demand. In this paper, we present our visual analytics tool, ViSeed, showcased on the data given in Syngenta 2016 crop data challenge                             1                             .

The laser-scanned point clouds are large-scale and precisely record complex 3D structures of the cultural assets. Accordingly, such point clouds are used in research field of visualization to support analysis and use of the assets. As representative examples of visualization, there are feature-highlighting and transparent visualization. The quality of visualization highly depends on distributional uniformity, that is, uniformity of inter-point distances. However, laser-scanned point clouds are usually distributional bias data, which makes it impossible to visualize with high quality. In previous studies, making point distances uniform by Poisson disk sampling, the quality of transparent visualization can be improved. This study proposes curvature-dependent Poisson disk sampling. The proposed method adjusts the order and radius of the sampling disk according to the curvature calculated by principal component analysis. By applying the proposed method to laser-scanned point clouds, the edges of cultural assets can be emphasized and the visibility of shape further improves in transparent visualization. Thereby, we realize feature-highlighting transparent visualization with high visibility of three-dimensional structure and edge-shape. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Curvature-dependent; Feature-highlighting; Laser-scanned point clouds; Poisson disk sampling; Principal component analysis; Transparent visualization","Principal component analysis; Visibility; Visualization; Curvature-dependent; Digital Archiving; Feature-highlighting; Laser measurements; Point cloud; Poisson-disk samplings; Support analysis; Three-dimensional structure; Three dimensional computer graphics","Springer Verlag","","18th Asia Simulation Conference, AsiaSim 2018","27 October 2018 through 29 October 2018","Kyoto","219959","18650929","978-981132852-7","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055666159"

The comparison is performed by alignment and registration of images or warping them with a transformation function. It is possible to compare images of the same patient, which have been taken at different time periods to detect or quantify the changes that might have taken place in-between acquisitions. Also, a comparison can be performed using images from different subjects. In a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI), intensity values do not only depend on the underlying tissue type. They also depend on developmental processes, scanner-related intensity artifacts and disease progression. Therefore, spatial normalization, which brings an image into the coordinate system of a template using a coordinate transformation to make meaningful comparisons of spatially varying data, is required. In this work, an intensity normalization method based on spatially varying distribution matching is proposed. The efficiency of the proposed method has been shown on brain MRIs. © 2017.","Bias field correction; Inhomogeneity correction; Intensity normalization; Intensity standardization; Spatial transformation","Artificial intelligence; Big data; Computer graphics; Computer vision; Data mining; Data visualization; Diagnosis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Metadata; Visualization; Bias field corrections; Inhomogeneity correction; Intensity normalization; Intensity standardization; Spatial transformation; Image processing","IADIS","","11th International Conferences on Computer Graphics, Visualization, Computer Vision and Image Processing, CGVCVIP 2017 and International Conference on Big Data Analytics, Data Mining and Computational Intelligence, BigDaCI 2017","21 July 2017 through 23 July 2017","Lisbon","132105","","978-989853366-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040173038"

We highlight qualitative results from a previous and extensive field study that shows how trust is still a problem in contemporary teams. These results motivate a specific examination of how developers form attributions of one another. We describe a collection of visualization widgets designed to address the specific issues found in the field. To evaluate their effectiveness, we performed a controlled laboratory study with 28 students and 12 professional software developers who used these visualizations collected into a tool environment called Theseus. The results show that in general, participants using the visualizations make more accurate attributions, and their perceived trustworthiness of their remote teammates more accurately reflects actual circumstances.

With DVR semi-transparency is facilitated to convey the complexity of the data. Unfortunately, semi-transparency introduces challenges in spatial comprehension of the data, as the ambiguities inherent to semi-transparent representations affect spatial comprehension. Accordingly, many techniques have been introduced to enhance the spatial comprehension of DVR images. In this paper, we present our findings obtained from two evaluations investigating the perception of semi-transparent structures from volume rendered images. We have conducted a user evaluation in which we have compared standard DVR with five techniques previously proposed to enhance the spatial comprehension of DVR images. In this study, we investigated the perceptual performance of these techniques and have compared them against each other in a large-scale quantitative user study with 300 participants. Each participant completed micro-tasks designed such that the aggregated feedback gives insight on how well these techniques aid the user to perceive depth and shape of objects. To further clarify the findings, we conducted a qualitative evaluation in which we interviewed three experienced visualization researchers, in order to find out if we can identify the benefits and shortcomings of the individual techniques. © 2018 The Authors Computer Graphics Forum © 2018 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","scientific visualization; volume visualization","Agglomeration; Data visualization; Transparency; Visualization; Volume rendering; Volumetric analysis; Computing methodologies; Direct volume rendering; Qualitative evaluations; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Scientific discipline; Semi transparencies; Volume visualization; Volumetric data sets; Image enhancement","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","01677055","","CGFOD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040163646"

One of various rendering methods is ray tracing. Ray tracing can produce a photorealistic image because it involves several calculations, lighting effects and optic effects. Lighting effects will calculate ambient, diffuse and specular. Optic effects will be gotten from calculation of mirror effect and transparency. To simulate transparency, we need to consider the material, in this case will represent by its refractive index. To calculate an accurate refraction ray, first the transparent object will be assumed as a solid object. So, the ray will travel inside the object before refract outside the object. Finally, every non-transparent object will keep the ray fall on its surface into an energy map. Some experiments had done to verify if the caustic effect visualized correctly. The other experiments are conducted to test the influent of refractive index, number of casted ray, light energy and map size toward the caustic's appearance. The more number of casted ray, higher light energy and bigger map size will produce brighter and wider caustic effect. The object's shape will affect where rays refracted. Round shape will gather the refracted ray into a small dense area. © 2016 IEEE.","caustic effect; optic effect; ray tracing; refraction; transparency","Light; Lighting; Refraction; Refractive index; Rendering (computer graphics); Three dimensional computer graphics; Transparency; 3-D environments; caustic effect; Light energy; Lighting effects; Photorealistic images; Rendering methods; Transparent objects; Visualization process; Ray tracing","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","18th International Electronics Symposium, IES 2016","29 September 2016 through 30 September 2016","Bali","126587","","978-150901640-2","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034079192"

To conquer this problem, we provide a new computational frame to cut lung tissue around the nodules by selective volume clipping. In this framework, an arbitrary-shaped closed curve centered on the nodule is first drawn in volume rendering. For facilitating the decision on whether the voxels should be retained, voxels through coordinate transformation are all projected onto screen frame. Then the voxels in the closed curve except for the voxels of pulmonary nodule are all cut off. Thus the occlusion problem can be solved in clinical visualization.

The proposed aerial 3D display is composed of an arc 3D display and aerial imaging by retro-reflection (AIRR), which features a wide viewing angle, a large-size scalability, and a low cost with mass-productive process. The arc 3D display consists of arc-shaped scratches on a transparent plastic plate. The principle of the arc 3D display is based on directional scattering. When a light impinges an arc-shaped scratch, the light is scattered mainly to the radial direction. The position of the bright spot on an arc scratch depends on the pupil position. The distance between the bright spots for both eyes on an arc scratches is proportional to the radius of curvature and is equivalent to the binocular parallax. Thus, by changing the radius of curvature, we can show a 3D image by use of a single LED illumination. This paper proposes an optical system to form an aerial 3D image with AIRR. AIRR consists of a light source, a beam splitter, and a retro-reflector. Arc scratches are illuminated by a quasi-parallel light that is generated by a Fresnel lens and a lightemitting diode (LED). In order to extract the directional scattered lights, we place the retro-reflector parallel to the beam splitter. The transmitted light does not impinge the beam splitter. Only the scattered lights reflect on the beam splitter and form the aerial image of the arc 3D display. © 2018 SPIE.","3D display; Aerial display; aerial imaging; binocular parallax; retro-reflection","Antennas; Binoculars; Geometrical optics; Imaging systems; Light emitting diodes; Light scattering; Nematic liquid crystals; Optical instruments; Optical systems; Prisms; Reflection; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Aerial imaging; Binocular parallax; Light emitting diode (LED); Radius of curvature; Retro reflection; Three-dimensional (3D) image; Transparent plastics; Wide viewing angle; Three dimensional displays","SPIE","NHK-ES; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Three-Dimensional Imaging, Visualization, and Display 2018","16 April 2018 through 17 April 2018","Orlando","138687","0277786X","978-151061843-5","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052379209"

Transparent visualization, on the other hand, visualizes the whole image and the inside at the same time, enables intuitive structure grasping, and is useful for three-dimensional visualization in the medical field. However, in transparent stereoscopy, the problem that the depth is underestimated rather than the actual object has been confirmed from the previous research. Therefore, in this study, we extract the surface of the volume data as a surface, overlap it with the original semitransparent volume to give a role as a silhouette, and make it a new clue to solve the problems of transparent stereopsis. Then, an evaluation experiment was conducted on the depth grasp of the medical images to which the proposed method was applied. The result shows that the depth was overestimated over the correct value under a plurality of conditions, and by fusing the surfaces, the surface to be compared was perceived more deeply.

This paper presents a volume rendering approach for phase space tessellations, that combines state-of-the-art order- independent transparency methods to manage the extreme depth complexity of this mesh type.

These visual analytic methods are beginning to be instantiated within mixed-initiative systems, where humans and machines collaboratively influence evidence-gathering and decision-making. But an open research question is that, when domain experts analyze their data, can they completely trust the outputs and operations on the machine-side? Visualization potentially leads to a transparent analysis process, but do domain experts always trust what they see? To address these questions, we present results from the design and evaluation of a mixed-initiative, visual analytics system for biologists, focusing on analyzing the relationships between familiarity of an analysis medium and domain experts' trust. We propose a trust-Augmented design of the visual analytics system, that explicitly takes into account domain-specific tasks, conventions, and preferences. For evaluating the system, we present the results of a controlled user study with 34 biologists where we compare the variation of the level of trust across conventional and visual analytic mediums and explore the influence of familiarity and task complexity on trust. We find that despite being unfamiliar with a visual analytic medium, scientists seem to have an average level of trust that is comparable with the same in conventional analysis medium. In fact, for complex sense-making tasks, we find that the visual analytic system is able to inspire greater trust than other mediums. We summarize the implications of our findings with directions for future research on trustworthiness of visual analytic systems. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","biological data analysis; familiarity; transparency; trust; uncertainty","Data mining; Data visualization; Decision making; Transparency; Uncertainty analysis; Biological data; Conventional analysis method; familiarity; Interactive visualizations; Mixed-initiative systems; trust; uncertainty; Visual analytics systems; article; biologist; comparative study; controlled study; human; trust; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85022186716"

We present SeekAView to address three main gaps in the existing research literature. First, automated methods like dimensionality reduction or clustering suffer from a lack of transparency in letting analysts interact with their outputs in real-Time to suit their exploration strategies. The results often suffer from a lack of interpretability, especially for domain experts not trained in statistics and machine learning. Second, exploratory visualization techniques like scatter plots or parallel coordinates suffer from a lack of visual scalability: it is difficult to present a coherent overview of interesting combinations of dimensions. Third, the existing techniques do not provide a flexible workflow that allows for multiple perspectives into the analysis process by automatically detecting and suggesting potentially interesting subspaces. In SeekAView we address these issues using suggestion based visual exploration of interesting patterns for building and refining multidimensional subspaces. Compared to the state-of-The-Art in subspace search and visualization methods, we achieve higher transparency in showing not only the results of the algorithms, but also interesting dimensions calibrated against different metrics. We integrate a visually scalable design space with an iterative workflow guiding the analysts by choosing the starting points and letting them slice and dice through the data to find interesting subspaces and detect correlations, clusters, and outliers. We present two usage scenarios for demonstrating how SeekAView can be applied in real-world data analysis scenarios. © 2016 IEEE.","Guided Visualization; High-Dimensional Data; Subspace Exploration","Clustering algorithms; Data handling; Information analysis; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Reduction; Transparency; Visualization; Curse of dimensionality; Dimensionality reduction; Exploration strategies; Exploratory visualizations; High dimensional data; High dimensional data visualization; High-dimensional data space; Parallel coordinates; Data visualization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","6th IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization, LDAV 2016","23 October 2016","Baltimore","126794","","978-150905659-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017223564"

Prior studies have analyzed trust duringsupervisory control of automation, and how trust influences reliance: the behavioral correlate of trust. Here, we investigated how reliance on haptic assistance affects performance during shared control with an automated system. Subjects made reaches towards a hidden target using a visual cue and haptic cue (assistance from the automation). We sought to influence reliance by changing the variability of trial-by-trial random errors in the haptic assistance. Reliance was quantified in terms of the subject's position at the end of the reach relative to the two cues. Our results show that subjects aimed more towards the visual cue when the variability of the haptic cue errors increased, resembling cue weighting behavior. Similar behavior was observed both when subjects had explicit knowledge about the haptic cue error variability, as well as when they had only implicit knowledge (from experience). However, the group with explicit knowledge was able to more quickly adapt their reliance on the haptic assistance.

Part of the problem arises from the inconsistent and patchy nature of data quality information, which makes intercomparison very difficult. Over recent years, the production and availability of geospatial data has significantly increased, facilitated by the recent explosion of Web-based catalogues, portals, standards and services, and by initiatives such as INSPIRE and GEOSS. Despite this significant growth in availability of geospatial data and the fact that geospatial datasets can, in many respects, be considered commercial products that are available for purchase online, consumer trust has to date received relatively little attention in the GIS domain. In this paper, we discuss how concepts of trust, trust models, and trust indicators (largely derived from B2C e-Commerce) apply to the GIS domain and to geospatial data selection and use. Our research aim is to support data users in more efficient and effective geospatial dataset selection on the basis of quality, trustworthiness and fitness for purpose. To achieve this, we propose a GEO label – a decision support mechanism that visually summarises availability of key geospatial data informational aspects. We also present a Web service that was developed to support generation of dynamic GEO label representations for datasets by combining producer metadata (from standard catalogues or other published locations) with structured user feedback. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.","Geospatial data quality and trustworthiness; Trust indicators; Trust visualisation","Decision support systems; Electronic commerce; Orbits; Visualization; Web services; Websites; Commercial products; Data-quality information; Dataset selections; Decision supports; Fitness for purpose; Geo-spatial data; Intercomparisons; Quality information; Data visualization","Springer New York LLC","","12th IFIP WG 11.11 International Conference on Trust Management, IFIPTM 2018","10 July 2018 through 13 July 2018","Toronto","215589","18684238","978-331995275-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049793655"

However, the usability of transparency has yet to be tested with intended users and it might vary from one application domain to another or from one task to another. This research project addresses the usability of transparency in 3D cadastre visualization, more specifically whether it helps users delimit property units (administrative boundaries) with their physical counterparts (e.g., walls) in condominium situation. In this situation, three types of boundaries (simple physical, simple administrative, and linked boundary, which is both physical and administrative) are involved in visualization, and three different transparency levels are used to represent these types. Empirical tests are administered in the form of an online questionnaire for university students in law (notarial law) and land surveying. The results show that, in general, using three different transparency levels is preferable and efficient solution to help users demarcate property units with their physical counterparts, and 63% participants correctly achieved their visual tasks with this design. Also, the transparency settings influence user’s performance. For example, applying very high transparency to simple administrative boundaries as compared to simple physical boundaries improves user certainty. Another important discovery is that many university students in notarial law are inexperienced with 3D visualization, and such inexperience affects the viewer’s certitude when carrying out visual tasks. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","3D cadastre; 3D geo-visualization; Transparency; Usability; Visual variables","Data visualization; Surveying; Surveys; Transparency; Usability engineering; Vision; Visualization; 3D cadastre; 3D Visualization; Geo visualizations; High transparency; Online questionnaire; University students; Usability; Visual variables; cadastre; empirical analysis; Internet; questionnaire survey; student; transparency; university sector; visualization; Three dimensional computer graphics","Springer New York LLC","","","","","","13846175","","GEOIF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84996524095"

Definining a tetrahedral mesh in phase space-with the tracer particles at initialization serving as vertices-yields a more accurate density field. At later timesteps, the mesh self-intersects to an enormous degree, making pre-sorting impossible. Kaehler et al [2012] visualize the mesh using cell projection, but their method requires order-independent compositing, which limits its flexibility. Our work renders the mesh using state of the art order-independent transparency (OIT) techniques to composite fragments in correct depth order. This also allows us to render variables other than density, such as velocity. We implement a number of OIT optimizations to handle the high depth complexity (on the order of 107 depth layers for 2×109 particles) of the data. Our performance measurements show near-interactive framerates for our hybrid renderer despite the large number of depth layers. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","GPU acceleration; Intersecting mesh; Order-independent transparency; Scientific visualization; Volume rendering","Data visualization; Electrooptical effects; Galaxies; Interactive computer graphics; Phase space methods; Transparency; Visualization; Volume rendering; Composite fragments; GPU accelerations; Intersecting mesh; Order independents; Order-independent transparencies; Performance measurements; Tetrahedral meshes; Uniform distribution; Mesh generation","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH)","2016 SIGGRAPH ASIA Symposium on Visualization, SA 2016","5 December 2016 through 8 December 2016","Macau","125101","","978-145034547-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006892859"

Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions. © 2018 IEEE.","attraction effect; bias alleviation; bias mitigation; cognitive bias; debiasing; Decision making; information visualization","Behavioral research; Decision making; Information systems; attraction effect; bias alleviation; bias mitigation; Cognitive bias; De-biasing; Information visualization; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052719402"

The threat is exaggerated as commodity OSes usually have a large code base and suffer from various software vulnerabilities. Nowadays, adversaries prefer to steal sensitive data by leaking the content of display output by a security-sensitive application. A promising solution is to exploit the hardware visualization extensions provided by modern ARM processors to construct a secure display path between the applications and the display device. In this work, we present a scheme named SecDisplay for trusted display service, it protects sensitive data displayed from being stolen or tampered surreptitiously by a compromised OS. The TCB of SecDisplay mainly consists of a tiny hypervisor and a super light-weight rendering painter, and has only ∼1400 lines of code. We implemented a prototype of SecDisplay and evaluated its performance overhead. The results show that SecDisplay only incurs an average drop of 3.4%.

The purpose of this article is to show how geographic information systems (GIS) can be used in the development of reforms in the sphere of public finance. GIS can become a very useful tool in the development of reforms. GIS could provide a wide range of analysis and provide better support for ideas of reforms. GIS is very useful in the case of public finance reform, because it makes it possible to combine statistical, demographical and geographical analysis. Also GIS provides very good visualization that helps ordinary citizens to understand an idea of reform and its aftereffects. GIS can increase transparency and accountability of government, because it is quite difficult to manipulate open map data. GIS is not a perfect tool and several challenges should be also considered. Firstly, the software for GIS must be revised quite often. Secondly, GIS software continues to change and improve over time and there are now several GIS applications that range from being relatively free (having limited tools) to being very expensive (for example, ArcGIS 10.). Thirdly, to follow the idea of increasing transparency, all GIS software should have no conflicts between each other. This means that data from one GIS software can be easily exported into different GIS applications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Geographic information systems; Public finance; Reforms; Taxpayer funds","Application programs; Industrial research; Information systems; Information use; Knowledge management; Taxation; Transparency; Visualization; Arcgis 10; Geographical analysis; GIS application; GIS software; Open maps; Public finance; Reforms; Taxpayer funds; Geographic information systems","CEUR-WS","BWT Group; DataArt; Logicify; Oleksandr Spivakovsky's Educational Foundation (OSEF); Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv","14th International Conference on ICT in Education, Research and Industrial Applications.

Despite that, we are still far from reaching fully the goal of transparency. Due to the lack of a shared protocol, each administration is free to choose the format to publish and present the data, resulting in a proliferation of different formats, different website structures and table of contents, which makes the exploration and discovering of facts and figures harder. Transparency without accessibility, is a lost opportunity. The paper will discuss these issues in the light of a new design and data storytelling oriented paradigm, intended to turn the mere online publication of data into a more engaging and immersive experience.

However, with the exception of digitally-driven services, little interest has focused on how visualization can better show how government works, its fabric, shifting contours, and complexity. This paper reviews different visual practice domains and their underlying craft logics and motivations. It makes a distinction between the application of visual tools in support of the ‘instrumental’ functions of government (associated with competing for, securing, and wielding the power) as opposed to ‘democratic functions’ (advising elected leaders, engaging citizens, and furthering accountability). It argues that the greatest inroads for visual tools has been in the more ‘instrumental areas’—supporting political parties and sitting governments for monitoring and service delivery—as opposed to furthering the larger aspirations of ‘democratic governance’. It concludes that for governments to invest more in visual tools for democratic governance will require political leadership and improved capacity inside government, and that sustained, systematic research will is required to monitor the take-up and influence of digital tools in these areas. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Accountability; Democratic governance; Engagement; Government; Information visualization; Policy-making; Visual practice; Visual tools; Visualization","","Springer","","","","","","25121812","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035101790"

However, conveying a hidden tumor's depth to the user effortlessly and precisely is still an unsolved problem. This is especially difficult in monocular laparoscopy. First, the number of available depth cues is in practice limited to only two: occlusion and relative size. Second, exploiting these cues is not an easy task either. We propose a specific visualization consisting of auxiliary orthographic tumor silhouettes on the front and back surfaces of the organ and a semi-transparent tumor in between. This creates two depth planes forming a perceivable ratio-scaled metric space for the tumor. We conducted a user study to evaluate the proposed visualization. The results show that subsurface tumor depth perception is improved dramatically compared to the conventional transparent overlay. © 2017 IEEE.","","Augmented reality; Depth perception; Laparoscopy; Visualization; Depth cue; Medical augmented realities; Metric spaces; Relative sizes; Semi-transparent; Transparent overlay; Unsolved problems; User study; Tumors","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","16th Adjunct IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR-Adjunct 2017","9 October 2017 through 13 October 2017","Nantes","131960","","978-076956327-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040249598"

Open data is also linked to smart cities, and hence important in this context, as it is the first step towards public transparency. Despite the wide range of Open Government Data, interpreting such data sets is a non-trivial task, due to the massive amount of raw data. This stimulates the search for techniques and methodologies that allow the interpretation of implicit information and deduction of new knowledge. One of the approaches used for these tasks involves the use of data visualizations. In addition to data visualizations classically used in descriptive statistics for data analysis, such as line or bar charts, many web sites have been used map visualization techniques. This type of visualization is important, since visualization of georeferenced data combined with other types of information can aid its interpretation. However, for data visualization construction on maps, it is necessary that the objects to be visualized are georeferenced. There are standards for turning such data available, however they are diverse, which may make it difficult for a single tool to display views from different sources. This work aims to present a framework that defines data standards for constructing data visualizations on maps of various types. Based on this framework, a tool was implemented to facilitate the creation of different map views, both by developers of open data portals and by users who analyze such data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Information Visualization in Maps; Open Government Data; Transparency","Information analysis; Information systems; Information use; Transparency; Visualization; Data standards; Descriptive statistics; Implicit informations; Information visualization; Map visualizations; Non-trivial tasks; Open Government Data; Public institution; Data visualization","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP); ACM Special Interest Group on Management Information Systems (SIGMIS); Sociedade Brasileira de Computacao (SBC)","14th Brazilian Symposium on Information Systems, SBSI 2018","4 June 2018 through 8 June 2018","Caxias do Sul","142905","","978-145036559-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060042699"

We aimed to examine the yield and potential for these healthcare process biases in defining a study baseline using EHR data, using the example of cholesterol and blood pressure (BP) measurements. Methods We created a virtual cohort study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) from patients with eligible cholesterol profiles in the New England (NE) and Southeast (SE) networks of the Veterans Health Administration in the United States. Using clinical data from the EHR, we plotted the yield of patients with BP measurements within an expanding timeframe around an index date of cholesterol testing. We compared three groups: (1) patients with BP from the exact index date; (2) patients with BP not on the index date but within the network-specific 90th percentile around the index date; and (3) patients with no BP within the network-specific 90th percentile. Results Among 589,361 total patients in the two networks, 146,636 (61.0%) of 240,479 patients from NE and 289,906 (83.1%) of 348,882 patients from SE had BP measurements on the index date. Ninety percent had BP measured within 11 days of the index date in NE and within 5 days of the index date in SE. Group 3 in both networks had fewer available race data, fewer comorbidities and CVD medications, and fewer health system encounters. Conclusions Requiring same-day risk factor measurement in the creation of a virtual CVD cohort study from EHR data might exclude 40% of eligible patients, but including patients with infrequent visits might introduce bias. Data visualization can inform study-specific strategies to address these challenges for the research use of EHR data. © 2018","Cardiovascular disease; Clinical research informatics; Data completeness; Data visualization; Secondary use","Aged; Bias; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol; Cohort Studies; Electronic Health Records; Epidemiologic Research Design; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Informatics; Middle Aged; United States; Blood pressure; Cardiology; Cholesterol; Clinical research; Diseases; eHealth; Records management; Risk assessment; Visualization; cholesterol; Cardio-vascular disease; Clinical research informatics; Data completeness; Electronic health record; Healthcare process; Information bias; Secondary use; Veterans health administrations; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; electronic health record; female; health care system; human; informed consent; major clinical study; male; patient care; population research; priority journal; risk factor; systolic blood pressure; United States; blood; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; electronic health record; medical informatics; middle aged; physiology; standards; statistical bias; statistics and numerical data; Data visualization","Academic Press Inc.","","","","","","15320464","","JBIOB","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85040677975"

For the visualization tool, graphics card driver should also support OpenGL. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Determining the crystal structure parameters of a material is a very important issue in crystallography. Knowing the crystal structure parameters helps the understanding of the physical behavior of material. For complex structures, particularly for materials which also contain local symmetry as well as global symmetry, obtaining crystal parameters can be very hard. Solution method: The tool extracts crystal parameters such as primitive vectors, basis vectors and identifies the space group from atomic coordinates of crystal structures. Reasons for new version: Additional features, Compatibility issues with newer development environments, Performance optimizations, Minor bug corrections. Summary of revisions:Defect quantification capability is added. The tool can process the imperfect crystal structures, finds and quantifies the crystalline defects. The tool is capable of finding positional defects, vacancy defects, substitutional impurities and interstitial impurities. The algorithms presented in [3] are used for defect quantification implementation.Transparency support is added to the visualization tool. Users are now allowed to set the transparency of each atom type individually.Runtime visibility sorting functionality is added to facilitate correct transparency computations.Visual Studio 2012 support is added. Visual Studio 2012 specific project files are created and the project is tested with this development environment.In visualization tool, an unused log file was created. This issue is corrected.In visualization tool, some OpenGL calls which are executed at every draw are changed to be executed only when they are needed, improving the visualization performance.Restrictions: Assumptions are explained in [1,2]. However, none of them can be considered as a restriction onto the complexity of the problem. Running time: The tool was able to process input files with more than a million atoms in less than 20 s on a PC with an Athlon quad-core CPU at 3.2 GHz using the default parameter values.

Evidence is collected, collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Analytical models; Buildings; Data models; Data visualization; Uncertainty; Visual analytics","Awareness; Computer Graphics; Human Engineering; Humans; Trust; Uncertainty; Analytical models; Buildings; Cognitive systems; Data structures; Data visualization; Decision making; Cognitive bias; Complex datasets; Knowledge construction; Knowledge generations; Uncertainty; Visual analytics; Visual analytics systems; Visual representations; awareness; bioengineering; computer graphics; human; psychology; trust; uncertainty; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84946595461"

We present the results of a small-scale study to better understand how display size and resolution affect insight. Analyzing participants' verbal statements, we find preliminary evidence that larger displays with more pixels can significantly increase the number of discoveries reported during visual exploration, while yielding broader, more integrative insights. Furthermore, we find important differences in how participants performed the same visual exploration task using displays of varying sizes.

Currently, it can involve a lot of manual data gathering, modelling and analyses. The results of data-driven analyses can be questioned due to inaccurate data affected by subtle contextual and human factors. Originally, we conducted two individual research projects that approached this same problem from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. According to our qualitative data quality research, current ambiguous and erroneous administrative timestamps should be more precise. A software development project indicates that the automatic process mining, discovery, modelling, and simulation could support healthcare process improvements by automating analytics and predictive simulations. However, contextual heterogeneity and data quality must be assessed carefully, and currently requires a lot of manual efforts. Our qualitative analyses identified and explained timestamp errors and semantic heterogeneity that cannot be currently identified from the data layer: data standards, data models and data sets. The synthesis of our findings indicates that software systems should collect metadata about user interactions and user interface structures. Additional metadata could then be used to discover and explain the actual meaning and contextual quality of recorded transaction data. We also noted that the automatic process visualization software, that discovers actual processes, could be more widely used to identify organizational data quality problems and opportunities for process improvement. © 2015 MIT Information Quality Program.

This paper describes a design methodology to enhance operators' decision making by providing trust cues so that their perceived trustworthiness of a system matches its actual trustworthiness, thus yielding calibrated trust. These trust cues consist of visualizations to diagnose the actual trustworthiness of the system by showing the risk and uncertainty of the associated information. We present a trust cue design taxonomy that lists all possible information that can influence a trust judgment. We apply this methodology to a scenario with advanced automation that manages missions for multiple unmanned vehicles and shows specific trust cues for 5 levels of trust evidence. By focusing on both individual operator trust and the transparency of the system, our design approach allows for calibrated trust for optimal decision-making to support operators during all phases of mission execution. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Automation; Bayesian Modeling; Cognitive Agents; Computational Trust Modeling; Cyber Operations; Trust; Trust Calibration; Trust Cues; Trustworthiness; Uncertainty Visualization; Unmanned Systems","Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Calibration; Decision making; Decision support systems; Uncertainty analysis; Unmanned vehicles; Virtual reality; Visualization; Bayesian model; Cognitive agents; Computational trust model; Cyber operations; Trust; Trust Cues; Trustworthiness; Uncertainty visualization; Unmanned system; Design","Springer Verlag","","6th International Conference on Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality, VAMR 2014 - Held as Part of 16th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, HCI International 2014","22 June 2014 through 27 June 2014","Heraklion, Crete","105933","03029743","978-331907457-3","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84903624795"

For the visual design of 3D scenes, in particular, effective texturing depends significantly on how important contents are expressed, e.g., by preserving global salient structures, and how their depiction is cognitively processed by the user in an application context. Edge-preserving image filtering is one key approach to address these concerns. Much research has focused on applying image filters in a post-process stage to generate artistically stylized depictions. However, these approaches generally do not preserve depth cues, which are important for the perception of 3D visualization (e.g., texture gradient). To this end, filtering is required that processes texture data coherently with respect to linear perspective and spatial relationships. In this work, we present an approach for texturing 3D scenes with perspective coherence by arbitrary image filters. We propose decoupled deferred texturing with (1) caching strategies to interactively perform image filtering prior to texture mapping and (2) for each mipmap level separately to enable a progressive level of abstraction, using (3) direct interaction interfaces to parameterize the visualization according to spatial, semantic, and thematic data. We demonstrate the potentials of our method by several applications using touch or natural language inputs to serve the different interests of users in specific information, including illustrative visualization, focus+context visualization, geometric detail removal, and semantic depth of field. The approach supports frame-to-frame coherence, order-independent transparency, multitexturing, and content-based filtering. In addition, it seamlessly integrates into real-time rendering pipelines and is extensible for custom interaction techniques. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Image filtering; Interaction; Level of abstraction; Texturing; Virtual 3D scenes; Visualization","Abstracting; Data visualization; Flow visualization; Mapping; Semantics; Textures; Texturing; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3D scenes; Focus+context visualization; Frame-to-frame coherence; Illustrative visualization; Image filtering; Interaction; Level of abstraction; Order-independent transparencies; Image texture","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","00978493","","COGRD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943201242"

The latest stand-alone version of the tool allows users to visualize their data exports. For analyzing the users’ perceptions of the Data Track in regard to transparency features and the concepts of data export and data portability, we have conducted a qualitative user study. We observed that although users had rather little interest in the visualization of derived data activities revealed in the Google location file, they were interested in other kinds of derived data like usage patterns for different service providers. Also, as earlier user studies revealed, we again confirmed that it is confusing for users to differentiate between locally and remotely stored and controlled data. Finally, in spite of being concerned about the security of the data exported to their machines, for exercising data portability rights pursuant to the General Data Protection Regulation, most participants would prefer to first export and edit the data before uploading it to another service provider and would appreciate using a tool such as the Data Track for helping them in this context. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.","Data portability; Data track; Transparency enhancing tools; Visualization","Data privacy; Flow visualization; Transparency; Visualization; Data portabilities; Data tracks; Different services; General data protection regulations; Karlstad University; Service provider; Stand-alone version; Usage patterns; Data visualization","Springer New York LLC","","11th Annual International Federation for Information Processing Summer School on Privacy and Identity Management, 2016","21 August 2016 through 26 August 2016"," Karlstad","190579","18684238","978-331955782-3","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85017507678"

Simulation and visualization experiment for the PC chamber is important to reveal PC emitters' working mechanism. So fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis on the hydraulic performance of PC emitters with ADINA software is studied. Transparent organic-glass test model with the same size as the real product is manufactured, and visualization experiments are carried out through a measuring system and a digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) system. Deformations of the diaphragm are acquired under different pressures. It shows that the increase of the diaphragm's deformation slows down with pressure. In the experiment, it is found that the diaphragm vibrates from inlet pressure of 75 kPa to 195 kPa. After that, the diaphragm fits closely to the PC chamber top, leaving only the little groove as the main flow channel. This means the discharge is adjusted through the diaphragm's tiny deformation during the constant-discharge stage. Combining with pressure distribution obtained from FSI analysis, the conclusion that the small flow section formed by the diaphragm and the inside wall is quite important to the hydraulic performance of the emitter is got. From DPIV experiments, velocity distributions of different sections are obtained. The experimental values agree well with the simulation results. In conclusion, FSI analysis together with visualization experiment is an efficient way to study PC emitters' working mechanism and guide their design. ©, 2015, Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

Analyzing such a scene requires separating the image into its individual layers, which remains a challenging and important problem. While the problem is very much ill-posed when only a single image is considered, recent work has shown that depth estimation for two layers becomes quite tractable when one instead captures a 4D light field of the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel variational approach to layer separation which is based on these ideas. We formulate a linear generative model to reconstruct the light field from disparity and luminance information for the individual layers on the center view. Comparing the model with the observerd data yields a convex variational problem for layer reconstruction, which can be solved to global optimality with a primal-dual scheme. Layer disparity is estimated in a first step, for which we improve upon a model based on second order structure tensors on the epipolar plane images. In contrast to previous work, the resulting approach is robust enough to be able to deal with light fields from the Lytro Illum camera, for which we obtain a compelling separation of the reflectance layer in real-world scenes. © 2015 The Eurographics Association.","","Separation; Visualization; Epipolar plane images; Global optimality; Linear generative model; Primal-dual schemes; Second order structure; Transparent surfaces; Variational approaches; Variational problems; Image processing","Eurographics Association","Eurographics; MVTec; NVIDIA; RWTH Aachen University","20th International Symposium on Vision, Modeling and Visualization, VMV 2015","7 October 2015 through 10 October 2015","Aachen","127005","","978-390567495-8","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986242188"

We argue that trust can be contagion and seeded by tools (spread from one individual to another through tools). Objective We sought to investigate the potential for using tools to support the development of trust in such teams and facilitate contagion trust. Specifically, we sought to investigate whether any existing tools support the development of trust in such teams and which information helps such development, whether the visualization of past collaborations would help developing trust, and what tools or features practitioners would wish for, if they had a magic wand. Method We interviewed 71 employees from five multinational organizations. We focused on gaining an understanding of the tools that are currently used to engender trust and the information needed to facilitate contagion, in which conditions visualizations of past collaborations are helpful, and what software tool features could help develop trust. Our analysis was guided by grounded theory. Results We found evidence that supports the theory of contagion trust and tools can be used to initiate the development of trust. These tools include software tools, office technologies, or organizational structures. Practitioners' needs were functional (e.g. audio channel with remote colleagues) and/or non-functional (e.g. can be adopted in sites with poor infrastructure). Conclusion Our study illustrates that tools can be used to facilitate contagion trust and provides three main contributions. First, our exploration of how existing tools are used provides a guide to effective practices in such teams. Second, the descriptions of features that can facilitate contagion trust provide useful design implications for future tools. Third, the identification of the kind of information that facilitates contagion trust provides an understanding of practitioners' underlying needs that can be used to develop collaboration tools. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Transparency mechanisms aim to mitigate this challenge by providing users with information about the robot's internal processes. While most research in human-robot interaction aim towards natural transparency using human-like verbal and non-verbal behaviors, our work advocates for the use of visualization-based transparency. In this paper, we first present an end-to-end system that infers task commands that refer to objects or surfaces in everyday human environments, using Bayesian inference to combine scene understanding, pointing detection, and speech recognition. We characterize capabilities of this system through systematic tests with a corpus collected from people (N=5). Then we design human-like and visualizationbased transparency mechanisms and evaluate them in a user study (N=20).

The HAI assay endpoint requires real-time monitoring of rapidly evolving red blood cell (RBC) patterns for signs of agglutination at a rate of potentially thousands of patterns per day to meet the throughput needs for clinical testing. This analysis is typically performed manually through visual inspection by highly trained individuals. However, concordant HAI results across different labs are challenging to demonstrate due to analyst bias and variability in analysis methods. To address these issues, we have developed a bench-top, standalone, high-throughput imaging solution that automatically determines the agglutination states of up to 9600 HAI assay wells per hour and assigns HAI titers to 400 samples in a single unattended 30-min run. Images of the tilted plates are acquired as a function of time and analyzed using algorithms that were developed through comprehensive examination of manual classifications. Concordance testing of the imaging system with eight different influenza antigens demonstrates 100% agreement between automated and manual titer determination with a percent difference of ≤3.4% for all cases. © 2015, 2015 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.","automation; hemagglutination inhibition assay; high-throughput; image analysis; influenza","Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Automation, Laboratory; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Optical Imaging; Orthomyxoviridae; Reproducibility of Results; Automation; Bacteria; Image analysis; Throughput; Viruses; influenza vaccine; Influenza virus hemagglutinin; virus antibody; virus antigen; Bias and variability; Comprehensive examination; High throughput; High-Throughput Imaging; influenza; Inhibition assays; Manual classification; Real time monitoring; algorithm; animal cell; Article; camera; computer program; controlled study; diagnostic equipment; dose response; erythrocyte; hemagglutination inhibition test; high throughput imaging and visualization equipment; human; image analysis; image processing; influenza; laboratory automation; nonhuman; seroconversion; vaccination; fluorescence imaging; hemagglutination inhibition test; high throughput screening; immunology; laboratory automation; Orthomyxoviridae; procedures; reproducibility; Antigen-antibody reactions","SAGE Publications Inc.","","","","","","22110682","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84962619414"

An effective information transfer of surface properties, encoded by textures, however, depends significantly on how important information is highlighted and cognitively processed by the user in an application context. Edge-preserving image filtering is a promising approach to address this concern while preserving global salient structures. Much research has focused on applying image filters in a post-process stage to foster an artistically stylized rendering, but these approaches are generally not able to preserve depth cues important for 3D visualization (e.g., texture gradient). To this end, filtering that processes texture data coherently with respect to linear perspective and spatial relationships is required. In this work, we present a system that enables to process textured 3D scenes with perspective coherence by arbitrary image filters. We propose decoupled deferred texturing with (1) caching strategies to interactively perform image filtering prior to texture mapping, and (2) for each mipmap level separately to enable a progressive level of abstraction.

By assigning proper transparency, it allows us to see more information inside the volume. However, because volume rendering projects complex 3D structures into the 2D domain, the resultant visualization often suffers from ambiguity and its spatial relationship could be difficult to recognize correctly, especially when the scene or setting is highly transparent. Stereoscopic displays are not the rescue to the problem even though they add an additional dimension which seems helpful for resolving the ambiguity. This paper proposes a thaumatrope method to enhance 3D understanding with stereoscopic transparency for volume rendering. Our method first generates an additional cue with less spatial ambiguity by using a high opacity setting. To avoid cluttering the actual content, we only select its prominent feature for displaying. By alternating the actual content and the selected feature quickly, the viewer only perceives a whole volume while its spatial understanding has been enhanced. A user study was performed to compare the proposed method with the original stereoscopic volume rendering and the static combination of the actual content and the selected feature using a 3D display. Results show that the proposed thaumatrope approach provides better spatial understanding than compared approaches. © 2015 IEEE.","stereoscopic display; Stereoscopic perception; volume rendering","Display devices; Medical imaging; Stereo image processing; Transparency; Visualization; Volume rendering; 3-D displays; 3D Structure; Prominent features; Spatial relationships; Stereoscopic display; Stereoscopic perceptions; User study; Visualization technique; Three dimensional computer graphics","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84936746565"

Previous work has shown that making distributed users better aware of each other's gestures facilitates remote collaboration. These systems presented virtual embodiments as a stream of raw 2D or 3D data - this data is noisy, and requires high bandwidth and favorable camera positions. Instead, our work uses a hand tracker to capture gestures which we visualize with a high-fidelity hand model. Our system is practical, requiring only a single depth sensor placed below the screen, and can be used without per-user calibration. As we use a 3D model rather than raw data, we can augment the hand's appearance to improve saliency and aesthetics. We alpha-blend this visualization over a shared workspace, so the local user perceives the remote user's hand as if they were separated by a transparent display. We conducted an experiment to compare traditional hand embodiments with our new technique, showing a quantitative improvement in selection accuracy and qualitative improvements in feelings of mutual understanding and engagement.

This paper proposes and illustrates an alternate holistic approach to big social data analytics, social set analysis (SSA), which is based on the sociology of associations, mathematics of set theory, and advanced visual analytics of event studies. We illustrate our new approach by applying it to relate real-world events with their reflections in terms of user interactions on social media platforms. We present and discuss a theoretical and conceptual model of social data followed by a formal description of our technique based on set theory and event studies with a real-world social data example from Facebook. We then illustrate our new approach by reporting on the design, development, and evaluation results of a state-of-the-art visual analytics dashboard, the Social Set Visualizer (SoSeVi). Using SoSeVi, we conducted a real-world case study that consists of approximately 90 million Facebook user interactions from 11 different companies that have been mentioned in the traditional media in relation to the garment factory accidents in Bangladesh, and analyze the results. The enterprise application domain for the dashboard is corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the targeted end-users are CSR researchers and practitioners. The design of the dashboard was based on the social set analysis approach to computational social science mentioned above. The development of the dashboard involved cutting-edge open source visual analytics libraries (D3.js) and creation of new visualizations such as of actor mobility across time and space, conversational comets, and more. Evaluation of the dashboard consisted of technical testing, usability testing, and domain-specific testing with CSR students and yielded positive results. In conclusion, we discuss the new analytical approach of social set analysis and conclude with a discussion of the benefits of set theoretical approaches based on the social philosophical approach of associational sociology. © 2015 IEEE.","Big data visual Analytics; Big social data; New Computational Models for Big Social Data; Social set analysis","Computation theory; Graph theory; Human computer interaction; Philosophical aspects; Set theory; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Visualization; Computational social science; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Enterprise applications; Graph theoretical approach; Philosophical approaches; Social datum; Social set analysis; Visual analytics; Big data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","CCF; et al.; Huawi; IEEE Computer Society; National Science Foundation (NSF); Springer","3rd IEEE International Conference on Big Data, IEEE Big Data 2015","29 October 2015 through 1 November 2015","Santa Clara","118870","","978-147999925-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963774884"

When semi-transparent geometry is present, correct rendering results require sorting of transparent structures. Additional complexity is introduced as the contributions from volumetric data have to be partitioned according to the geometric objects in the scene. The A-buffer, an enhanced framebuffer with additional per-pixel information, has previously been introduced to deal with the complexity caused by transparent objects. In this paper, we present an optimized rendering algorithm for hybrid volume-geometry data based on the A-buffer concept. We propose two novel components for modern GPUs that tailor memory utilization to the depth complexity of individual pixels. The proposed components are compatible with modern A-buffer implementations and yield performance gains of up to eight times compared to existing approaches through reduced allocation and reuse of fast cache memory. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach and its performance with several examples from molecular biology, space weather and medical visualization containing both, volumetric data and geometric structures. We present an A-buffer based algorithm that achieves performance gains of up to eight times relative existing techniques. The algorithm contains two novel components which improve the utilization of the local cache memory on the GPU.

These fields overlap most significantly when training is involved: The visualization or machine learning tool improves over time by exploiting observations of the human-computer interaction. This article focuses on one aspect of the human-computer interaction that we call user-driven sampling strategies. Unlike relevance feedback and active learning sampling strategies, where the computer selects which data to label at each iteration, we investigate situations where the user selects which data are to be labeled at each iteration. User-driven sampling strategies can emerge in many visual analytics applications, but they have not been fully developed in machine learning. User-driven sampling strategies suggest new theoretical and practical research questions for both visualization science and machine learning. In this article, we identify and quantify the potential benefits of these strategies in a practical image analysis application. We find user-driven sampling strategies can sometimes provide significant performance gains by steering tools toward local minima that have lower error than tools trained with all of the data. In preliminary experiments, we find these performance gains are particularly pronounced when the user is experienced with the tool and application domain. © The Author(s) 2015.","active learning; interactive machine learning; relevance feedback; sampling bias; Visual analytics","Artificial intelligence; Feedback; Learning systems; Visualization; Active Learning; Interactive machine learning; Relevance feedback; Sampling bias; Visual analytics; Human computer interaction","SAGE Publications Ltd","","","","","","14738716","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84960946106"

While silhouette enhancements and local transparency mappings proved useful for semi-transparent depictions, they still introduce visual clutter when surfaces grow more complex. An effective visualization of the flow requires a balance between the presentation of interesting surface parts and the avoidance of occlusions that hinder the view. In this paper, we extend the concept of opacity optimization to surfaces to obtain a global approach to the occlusion problem. Starting with a partition of the surfaces into patches, we compute per-patch opacity as minimizer of a bounded-variable least-squares problem. For the final rendering, opacity is interpolated on the surfaces.

GeoSOT-3D grid is introduced, which makes a recursive quad subdivide, and builds a strict octree. Each grid could be supposed as a block, which is stored in the database by specific structure. When the blocks piece together, true 3D effects will appear. Then some visualization methods are introduced, such as surface display, transparent process. After some experiments, the globe geomagnetic data is expressed, according to 388800 grids. The experiment shows, it is feasible to express the Earth field data by GeoSOT-3D grid, with high efficiency, good visual effects, and better operability.

Source versioning systems can provide information about code ownership. However, the considerable amount of data collected might prolong the time to retrieve the information needed. OvERVIeW addresses this issue: it collects data from a versioning system and visualizes developers' effort using a well-known and intuitive visualization, the word cloud. We applied pre-attentive processing principles in the designing phase, which use graphical properties (e.g., form and color) that are processed pre-attentively, i.e., they are understood faster. In our visualization, each word represents a class; the number of lines added and removed (during a given time period) is used as size metric, and the color represents the developer(s) working on the code. We show how OvERVIeW can be used to visualize three different cases of code ownership: collective, weak, and strong. We report a sample application of OvERVIeW in the context of a multi-developer OSS project. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Such visualization typically involves the use of polygon graphics in which the polygons must be sorted along the line of sight. However, sorting involves considerable computation time for large-scale data. Furthermore, the order of polygons in the sorting can often become indefinite, especially for intersecting surfaces. Therefore, particle-based volume rendering that does not require sorting is proposed as a transparent-rendering method. The proposed method obtains slice images with non-uniform opacity using color and opacity maps similar to volume rendering. The method initially generates the particles, a process it performs only once. It additionally employs particle shuffling, which requires considerably less computation time than particle sorting. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we rendered 3D-fused images, including slice–slice and volume–slice images, for medical volumetric data. The results show that the performance of the proposed method is satisfactory in cases in which the area of the particle is greater than that of the cell. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Fused visualization; High-resolution volumetric data; Particle-based surface rendering","Computer graphics; Data visualization; Geometry; Health care; Medical imaging; Opacity; Screening; Sorting; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Volume rendering; Volumetric analysis; Fused visualizations; Intersecting surfaces; Point-based rendering; Rendering methods; Surface rendering; Three dimensional (3D) structures; Transparent surfaces; Volumetric data; Three dimensional computer graphics","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","4th KES International Conference on Innovation in  Medicine and Healthcare, InMed 2016","15 June 2016 through 17 June 2016","Tenerife","177299","21903018","978-331939686-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979041793"

WWF is bridging this gap by putting extensive spatial data into an easy to use online mapping environment, to allow visualization, manipulation and analysis of large data sets by any user. Consistent, reliable and repeatable ecosystem monitoring information for priority eco-regions is needed to increase transparency in WWF's global conservation work, to measure conservation impact, and to provide communications with the general public and organization members. Currently, much of this monitoring and evaluation data is isolated, incompatible, or inaccessible and not readily usable or available for those without specialized software or knowledge. Launched in 2013 by WWF Netherlands and WWF Germany, the Global Observation and Biodiversity Information Portal (GLOBIL) is WWF's new platform to unite, centralize, standardize and visualize geo-spatial data and information from more than 150 active GIS users worldwide via cloud-based ArcGIS Online. GLOBIL is increasing transparency, providing baseline data for monitoring and evaluation while communicating impacts and conservation successes to the public. GLOBIL is currently being used in the worldwide marine campaign as an advocacy tool for establishing more marine protected areas, and a monitoring interface to track the progress towards ocean protection goals. In the Kavango-Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation area, local partners are using the platform to monitor land cover changes, barriers to species migrations, potential human-wildlife conflict and local conservation impacts in vast wildlife corridor. In East Africa, an early warning system is providing conservation practitioners with real-time alerts of threats particularly to protected areas and World Heritage Sites by industrial extractive activities. And for globally consistent baseline ecosystem monitoring, MODIS-derived data are being combined with local information to provide visible advocacy for conservation. As GLOBIL is built up through the WWF network, the worldwide organization is able to provide open access to its data on biodiversity and remote sensing, spatial analysis and projects to support goal setting, monitoring and evaluation, and fundraising activities.","Conservation; Evaluation; GIS; Habitat; Impact; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Wildlife","Animals; Biodiversity; Data visualization; Decision making; Ecosystems; Geographic information systems; Monitoring; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Transparency; Ecosystem monitoring; Evaluation; Global observation; Habitat; Impact; Information portals; Monitoring and evaluations; Remote-sensing; Spatial data; Wildlife; Conservation","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","","2015 36th International Symposium on Remote Sensing of Environment","11 May 2015 through 15 May 2015","Berlin","112074","16821750","978-162993429-7; 978-162993512-6; 978-162993520-1","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930402664"

We explore several different AR visualization techniques. They are transparent overlay, virtual window, random-dot mask and the ghosting method. We also introduce the depth-aware ghosting method to further enhance the depth perception of virtual structure which has complex spatial geometry.

However, data provided by citizens (referred to as citizen data in this article) suffer two limitations for mapping: bias in spatial coverage and imprecision in spatial location. This article presents an approach to minimizing the impacts of these two limitations of citizen data using geospatial analysis techniques. The approach reduces location imprecision by adopting a frequency-sampling strategy to identify representative presence locations from areas over which citizens observed the geographic phenomenon. The approach compensates for the spatial bias by weighting presence locations with cumulative visibility (the frequency at which a given location can be seen by local citizens). As a case study to demonstrate the principle, this approach was applied to map the habitat suitability of the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) in Yunnan, China. Sightings of R. bieti were elicited from local citizens using a geovisualization platform and then processed with the proposed approach to predict a habitat suitability map. Presence locations of R. bieti recorded by biologists through intensive field tracking were used to validate the predicted habitat suitability map. Validation showed that the continuous Boyce index (Bcont(0.1)) calculated on the suitability map was 0.873 (95% CI: [0.810, 0.917]), indicating that the map was highly consistent with the field-observed distribution of R. bieti. Bcont(0.1) was much lower (0.173) for the suitability map predicted based on citizen data when location imprecision was not reduced and even lower (−0.048) when there was no compensation for spatial bias. This indicates that the proposed approach effectively minimized the impacts of location imprecision and spatial bias in citizen data and therefore effectively improved the quality of mapped spatial variation using citizen data. It further implies that, with the application of geospatial analysis techniques to properly account for limitations in citizen data, valuable information embedded in such data can be extracted and used for scientific mapping. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","citizen data; location imprecision; Rhinopithecus bieti; spatial bias; volunteered geographic information (VGI)","China; Yunnan; Pygathrix bieti; analytical method; GIS; habitat quality; mapping method; sampling; spatial variation; ungulate; visualization","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","","","","","13658816","","IGISF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941803575"

It simulates light propagation through the components of the DIC microscope to the image plane using a combined geometrical and physical optics approach and replicates the DIC image of the illuminated object.

The exploration of several layers and correlations between these is not common to traditional user interfaces, where the interaction is often constrained to two dimensions.

As a result, when we successfully perform multi-objective optimization studies, we produce a large number of data points in a high-dimensional space. In order to develop understanding of the complexities in such problems, we need to simultaneously visualise the design parameters and objective functions spaces and reveal the patterns of optimum performance, but also the discontinuous areas of infeasibility. By achieving this, we can potentially benefit in many ways. Firstly, the information that is extracted from such analysis can explicitly support human-in-the-loop computational design methodologies. Secondly, multi-fidelity optimization approaches can be guided and further enhanced with trust region approaches. Thirdly, identify the causes and reasons for the activation of the physical mechanisms that are responsible for improved, but also degraded, flow behavior in compressors design. And finally, the identification of design rules and characterization of the complexity in real-world engineering design. We use the Parallel Coordinates technique to manage the visualization and interaction of such hyper-planes. The illustrative case study used is the 3D aerodynamic design of compressor blades, considering 26 design parameters for the geometry management and 2 objective functions to model two of the critical flow characteristics (c1 - entropy generation, c2 - blockage).","Engineering optimization; Multi-dimensional design space visualization; Post-optimization analysis","Entropy; Multiobjective optimization; Product design; Visualization; Computational engineering; Engineering optimization; High dimensional spaces; Multi dimensional; Multi-fidelity optimization; Post optimization; Trust-region approach; Turbo-machinery design; Machine design","National Technical University of Athens","","1st International Conference on Engineering and Applied Sciences Optimization, OPT-i 2014","4 June 2014 through 6 June 2014","Kos Island","108723","","978-960999946-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911903613"

Since previous research indicates that measurement tasks can be usually carried out more efficiently in VR environments than in desktop-based systems, we have concentrated on the development of selection tools for medical models. These models have a set of particularities such as the presence of semi-transparencies, and there is a lack of tools for measurement support for such models in VR environments. Our VR-based interaction technique uses the data to automatically generate candidate anchor points, and it is specially focused on the efficient selection of 3D points in datasets rendered using methods with semi-transparency such as Direct Volume Rendering. We will show that our method is effective, precise, and reduces the time and amount of movements required to set the anchor points as compared with other classical techniques based on clipping planes. We also provide a couple of improvements tailored to reduce the inherent imprecision of 3D devices due to hand vibration, and the flexibility in transfer function selection for anchor point definition. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","3D interaction; 3D selection; Medical visualization; Virtual reality","Transparency; Virtual reality; Volume rendering; 3D interactions; 3D selection; Classical techniques; Direct volume rendering; Interaction techniques; Medical visualization; Pathological structures; Semi transparencies; Computer vision","Springer Verlag","","","","","","18650929","978-366244910-3","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84908519210"

They are constantly required to make sense of these data and consequently to make appropriate decisions. To effectively manage the complexity of information and to avoid to be overwhelmed by it, humans unconsciously apply heuristics. These heuristics, although generally useful, can lead to systematic errors in judgment, so-called cognitive biases. Research in the area of information visualisation has shown a positive effect of visualisations on the sense-making process by supporting humans in their understanding and interpreting of large data sets. This paper gives an overview of the current research in the following two areas (1) cognitive biases with its mitigation strategies and (2) information visualisation.

Based on the scheme, we discuss the factors affecting the trust intention, analyze the trust relation types, and propose trust intention calculation algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Access control; Social network; Trust intention; Trust relation","Computer aided manufacturing; Hypertext systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Access control policies; Calculation algorithms; Networked-manufacturing; Social relations; Trust intention; Trust relation; Trust relationship; Access control","Springer Verlag","","13th International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization, and Engineering, CDVE 2016","24 October 2016 through 27 October 2016","Sydney","185559","03029743","978-331946770-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994099888"

Due to their economic importance, reputation systems are subject to many attacks. A common problem are unfair ratings which are used to unfairly increase or decrease the reputation of an entity. Although being of high practical relevance, unfair rating attacks have only rarely been considered in literature. The few approaches that have been proposed are furthermore quite non-Transparent to the user. In this work, we employ visual analytics to identify colluding digital identities. The ultimate benefit of our approach is the transparent revelation of the true reputation of an entity by interactively using both endogenous and exogenous discounting methods. We thereto introduce a generic conceptual design of a visual analytics component that is independent of the underlying reputation system. We then describe how this concept was implemented in a software prototype. Subsequently, we demonstrate its proper functioning by means of an empirical study based on two real-world datasets from eBay and Epinions. Overall, we show that our approach notably enhances transparency, bares an enormous potential and might thus lead to substantially more robust reputation systems and enhanced user experience.","Collusion; Reputation System; Trust; Unfair Ratings; Visual Analytics","Conceptual design; Information systems; Software prototyping; User interfaces; Visualization; Collusion; Reputation systems; Trust; Unfair ratings; Visual analytics; Online systems","Association for Information Systems","","23rd European Conference on Information Systems, ECIS 2015","26 May 2015 through 29 May 2015","Munster","114929","","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007575161"

We conduct experiments to empirically testify the influences of dimensional information on perceptual biases. First, we confirm the conspicuity of areal information. When instructed to estimate rates exclusively relying on either linear or volumetric information, people would inevitably be influenced by the corresponding rates determined by areal information.

Trust has been seen as an important factor for other technologies, but little attention has previously been given to trust in VR systems.

In this research, these questions were studied by evaluating FreeBu, a semi-automatic and interactive grouping technology that visualizes Facebook friends. The results indicate that audience visualizations are especially perceived useful for grouping and reflection purposes.

This paper presents an energy-saving color scheme selection and optimization approach for direct volume rendering on OLED displays. We propose an illumination-aware energy estimating model that formulates a simplified equation between the display energy consumption and a specific color scheme in object space, making it practical to achieve global color scheme optimization. By performing the color scheme optimization, we obtain an optimal color transfer function, with which we can generate energy-aware direct volume rendering images for OLED display.

The proposed algorithm is a novel object-based approach which eliminates many of the shortcomings of state-of-the-art image-based DoF algorithms. Based on observations derived from a physically-correct reference renderer, coverage-based opacity estimation exploits semi-transparency to simulate the blur inherent to DoF effects. It achieves high quality DoF effects, by augmenting each atom with a semi-transparent shell, which has a radius proportional to the distance from the focal plane of the camera. Thus, each shell represents an additional coverage area whose opacity varies radially, based on our observations derived from the results of multi-sampling DoF algorithms. By using the proposed technique, it becomes possible to generate high quality visual results, comparable to those achieved through ground-truth multi-sampling algorithms. At the same time, we obtain a significant speedup which is essential for visualizing MD data as it enables interactive rendering. In this paper, we derive the underlying theory, introduce coverage-based opacity estimation and demonstrate how it can be applied to real world MD data in order to achieve DoF effects. We further analyze the achieved results with respect to performance as well as quality and show that they are comparable to images generated with modern distributed ray tracing engines. © 2015 IEEE.","I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism - Color; shading; shadowing; texture","Molecular dynamics; Opacity; Textures; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Distributed ray tracing; I.3.7 [computer graphics]: three-dimensional graphics and realism; Interactive rendering; Molecular visualization; Semi transparencies; shading; shadowing; State of the art; Rendering (computer graphics)","IEEE Computer Society","IEEE Computer Society Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","2015 8th IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium, PacificVis 2015","14 April 2015 through 17 April 2015","Hangzhou","113994","21658765","978-146736879-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84942247247"

Among the many methods, depth-peeling is an efficient solution for rendering polygon meshes transparently; however, the computational cost is related to the number of passes through the peeled geometry. Therefore, the depth-peeling method cannot efficiently render large and complex polygon meshes that require many passes through the geometry. In this paper, we solve this problem using a stochastic point-based rendering (SPBR) method. We use two types of large-scale and complex polygon meshes that have 5,744,376 and 4,800,644 triangles in the experiments. The rendering speed of our method is 3-5 times faster than that of the depth-peeling method for an image resolution of 512 × 512. Additionally, the SPBR method has an inherent visual effect: the outlines of target polygon meshes can be automatically enhanced. This makes the results of the SPBR method more vivid and comprehensible than those of the depth-peeling method.","Large-scale polygons; Stochastic point-based rendering; Transparent visualization","Computational geometry; Data visualization; Geometry; Image resolution; Interactive computer graphics; Stochastic systems; Visualization; Complex surface; Computational costs; Large-scale polygons; Medical data; Point-based rendering; Polygon meshes; Visual effects; Rendering (computer graphics)","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (SIGGRAPH); ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI)","SIGGRAPH Asia, SA 2015","2 November 2015 through 6 November 2015","Kobe","118042","","978-145033929-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959576230"

Trust is a critical concept since the presence or absence of the right level of trust can affect user behavior, and ultimately, the overall system performance. In this paper, we look across four studies to explore the relationship between UI elements and human trust behavior.

In this approach, we extend our stochastic projected tetrahedral (SPT) algorithm to treat irregular volumes. The SPT algorithm is a sorting-free volume rendering algorithm that projects a tetrahedral cell onto an image plane and controls the particle rendering using the opacity as the probability in the rasterization process. In the rasterization process, the particle depth is determined as that of a pre-defined location, which may be the front, back or middle point on a ray segment in the SPT algorithm. This determination causes a prominent artifact when treating multiple volumes, although it does not cause any problem when treating a single volume. The artifact occurs because the SPT algorithm controls the particle stochastically in the image plane but not in the depth direction. In the volume rendering process, it is assumed that the number of particles follows a Poisson distribution along the segment of the viewing ray that intersects the tetrahedral cell.

With this in mind, we have developed a novel trustworthiness metric which is designed to provide a relative score based on several key factors that influence trust, such as information's provenance and quality, and the integrity of the infrastructure through which the information passes. In this paper we consider whether providing insight into the various factors that make-up the resulting trustworthiness score actually helps to build trust in the metric itself, and whether users can successfully understand the advice being conveyed. Specifically, we present here the results of experiments which explore whether or not the visual interface that enables users to understand how the metric is composed of a combination of scores, across a range of factors, is a feature they are cognitively able to process, and whether it might help to build confidence in the trustworthiness advice being provided. © 2013 IEEE.","decision-making; information quality; risk communication; Trust metrics; trustworthiness visualisation","Computer programming; Computer science; Amount of information; Building users; Decision supports; Information quality; Risk communication; Trust metrics; Visual Interface; Decision support systems","","IEEE; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC); Deakin University, School of Information Technology","12th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications, TrustCom 2013","16 July 2013 through 18 July 2013","Melbourne, VIC","102394","","978-076955022-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84893500868"

In real-time explorative visualization it is common to render the resulting data using opaque spherical glyphs with local lighting only. Due to massive overlaps, however, inner structures of the data are often occluded rendering visual analysis impossible. Furthermore, local lighting is not sufficient as several important features like complex shapes, holes, rifts or filaments cannot be perceived well. To address both problems we present a new technique that jointly supports transparency and ambient occlusion in a consistent illumination model. Our approach is based on the emission-absorption model of volume rendering. We provide analytic solutions to the volume rendering integral for several density distributions within a spherical glyph. Compared to constant transparency our approach preserves the three-dimensional impression of the glyphs much better. We approximate ambient illumination with a fast hierarchical voxel cone-tracing approach, which builds on a new real-time voxelization of the particle data. Our implementation achieves interactive frame rates for millions of static or dynamic particles without any preprocessing. We illustrate the merits of our method on real-world data sets gaining several new insights. © 2015 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2015 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

We formulate two requirements for legal machines: 1) the software architecture must be accessible; and 2) the software must provide legal protection. A need therefore arises for the legal requirements to flow down to lower-level specifications. Further we explain the notion of subsumption-a legal qualification of facts in the setting of a norm.

Thus, there is an imperative need for well-established principles that will aid the right decision-making regarding the selection of the best candidate. Unfortunately, the choice of the most appropriate estimation technique is not a trivial task, due to the multi-faceted nature of error. Accuracy, bias and variance are notions describing different aspects of predictive power that someone has to take into consideration during the validation process. The main objective of this paper is the utilization of visual analytics for the evaluation of two fundamental ingredients of prediction accuracy: the bias and the variance.

The proposed method follows a bottom-up approach to predict the 3D regions where observers tend to hold their gaze for longer periods. Fusion of the feature maps is combined with a center-bias weighting function to determine 3D visual saliency map.

Data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse and redistribute it. The main benefits that a government can obtain from Open Data include transparency, participation and collaboration. The aim of this research is to promote transparency and accountability of the Federal Government of Australia by using Cloud-related technologies to transform a set of publicly available data into human-friendly visualizations in order to facilitate its analysis. The datasets include details of politicians, parties, political opinions and government contracts among others. This paper describes the stages involved in transforming an extensive and diverse collection of data to support effective visualization that helps to highlight patterns in the datasets that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to identify.","","Data visualization; Information management; Metadata; Transparency; Visualization; Australia; Cloud-based; Federal governments; Government contract; Human-friendly; New zealand; Open datum; Public information; Big data","CEUR-WS","","1st Symposium on Information Management and Big Data, SIMBig 2014","8 September 2014 through 10 September 2014","Cusco","109646","16130073","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84919685046"

The effectiveness of this approach depends on how the visual variables chosen for representing uncertainty and other attributes interact to influence the user's perception of each variable. We report a user study on the perception of graph edge attributes when uncertainty associated with each edge and the main edge attribute are visualized simultaneously using two separate visual variables. The study covers four visual variables that are commonly used for visualizing uncertainty on line graphical primitives: lightness, grain, fuzziness, and transparency. We select width, hue, and saturation for visualizing the main edge attribute and hypothesize that we can observe interference between the visual variable chosen to encode the main edge attribute and that to encode uncertainty, as suggested by the concept of dimensional integrality. Grouping the seven visual variables as color-based, focus-based, or geometry-based, we further hypothesize that the degree of interference is affected by the groups to which the two visual variables belong. We consider two further factors in the study: discriminability level for each visual variable as a factor intrinsic to the visual variables and graph-task type (visual search versus comparison) as a factor extrinsic to the visual variables. Our results show that the effectiveness of a visual variable in depicting uncertainty is strongly mediated by all the factors examined here. Focus-based visual variables (fuzziness, grain, and transparency) are robust to the choice of visual variables for encoding the main edge attribute, though fuzziness has stronger negative impact on the perception of width and transparency has stronger negative impact on the perception of hue than the other uncertainty visual variables. We found that interference between hue and lightness is much greater than that between saturation and lightness, though all three are color-based visual variables. We also found a compound relationship between discriminability level and the degree of dimensional integrality. We discuss the generalizability and limitation of the results and conclude with design considerations for visualizing graph uncertainty derived from these results, including recommended choices of visual variables when the relative importance of data attributes and graph tasks is known. © 2015 IEEE.","graph visualization; perception; uncertainty visualization; Visual variable","Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy systems; Graph theory; Sensory perception; Transparency; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Design considerations; Discriminability; Graph visualization; Graphical primitives; Uncertainty visualization; User's perceptions; Visual variables; Visualizing uncertainties; Encoding (symbols)","IEEE Computer Society","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84941100102"

While the London Charter has been in the process of revision and distribution to the heritage community, game engines have become less expensive and more approachable. Several engines offer the ability to publish easily across operating systems, mobile devices, and the web, causing a rapid expansion in their use for archeological visualization. However, the very power of game engines to create and publish immersive content poses fundamental challenges to the emphasis on data-driven visualization and transparency expressed in the London Charter. These challenges should not be suppressed, since they can prove heuristically fruitful if they are explicitly recognized and explored. This potential is illustrated by a descriptive analysis of the recreation of the House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii by an undergraduate humanities class, which concludes that the immersive effects of engine-based visualizations are as much to be found in their creation as in their “playing.” This suggests the value of democratizing the creation of game engine content for heritage visualization beyond research visualization laboratories, as a part of undergraduate curricula in the humanities. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Game engines; Heritage visualization; Pompeii; Presence theory","3D modeling; Transparency; Visualization; Cultural heritages; Descriptive analysis; Game Engine; International standards; Pompeii; Presence theory; Rapid expansion; Undergraduate curricula; Data visualization","Springer London","","","","","","09515666","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84911007161"

To infer whether a target is threatening and to which degree is far from a trivial task. Expert operators have normally to their aid different support systems that analyze the incoming data and provide recommendations for actions. Since the ultimate responsibility lies in the operators, it is crucial that they trust and know how to configure and use these systems, as well as have a good understanding of their inner workings, strengths and limitations. To limit the negative effects of inadequate cooperation between the operators and their support systems, this paper presents a design proposal that aims at making the threat evaluation process more transparent. We focus on the initialization, configuration and preparation phases of the threat evaluation process, supporting the user in the analysis of the behavior of the system considering the relevant parameters involved in the threat estimations.

This dataset can be characterized as a dynamic bipartite network with quantitative flows and a large number of vertices. Currently, there is no adequate visualization approach for data of this structure. We designed a visualization providing coordinated multiple views of aggregated attribute values as well as short tables of top sorted vertices that can be explored in detail by linked selection across multiple views.

While this is not inherently bad, this behavior extends to micro-blogging platforms: central locations get more attention in terms of information flow. In this paper we study the effects of an information filtering algorithm that decentralizes content in such platforms. Particularly, we found that users from non-central locations were not able to identify the geographical diversity on timelines generated by the algorithm, which were diverse by construction. To make users see the inherent diversity, we define a design rationale to approach this problem, focused on the treemap visualization technique. Then, we deployed an ""in the wild"" implementation of our proposed system. On one hand, we found that there are effects of centralization in exploratory user behavior. On the other hand, we found that the treemap was able to make users see the inherent geographical diversity of timelines. We measured these effects based on how users engaged with content filtered by the algorithm. With these results in mind, we propose practical actions for micro-blogging platforms to account for the differences and biased behavior induced by centralization. © Copyright 2016 ACM.","Centralization; Information Filtering; Information Visualization; Location Bias","Behavioral research; Forestry; Information systems; Location; User interfaces; Visualization; Central locations; Centralization; Design rationale; Information flows; Information visualization; Micro-blogging platforms; Treemap visualization; User behaviors; Information filtering","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGAI; ACM SIGCHI","21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, IUI 2016","7 March 2016 through 10 March 2016","Sonoma","119742","","978-145034137-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963758885"

So 3D video are widely known as a familiar image of technology now. The display representing the 3D image are there such as eyewear, naked-eye, the HMD-type, etc. They has been used for different applications and location. But have not been widely studied for the transparent 3D display. If transparent large 3D display is realized, it is useful to display 3D image overlaid on real scene in some applications such as road sign, shop window, screen in the conference room etc. As a previous study, to produce a transparent 3D display by using a special transparent screen and number of projectors is proposed. However, for smooth motion parallax, many projectors are required. In this paper, we propose a display that has transparency and large display area by time multiplexing projection image in time-division from one or small number of projectors to active screen. The active screen is composed of a number of vertically-long small rotate mirrors. It is possible to realize the stereoscopic viewing by changing the image of the projector in synchronism with the scanning of the beam.3D vision can be realized by light is scanned. Also, the display has transparency, because it is possible to see through the display when the mirror becomes perpendicular to the viewer. We confirmed the validity of the proposed method by using simulation. © 2015 SPIE.","3D display; active screen; large display area; mirror; projector; simulation; time-division; Transparency","Display devices; Geometrical optics; Imaging systems; Mirrors; Stereo image processing; Transparency; Visualization; 3-D displays; Active screen; Large displays; projector; simulation; Time division; Three dimensional computer graphics","SPIE","NHK-ES; The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Three-Dimensional Imaging, Visualization, and Display 2015","20 April 2015 through 21 April 2015","Baltimore","113182","0277786X","978-162841611-4","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84954039976"

Yet we also describe problematic consequences that arise as a result of meters, distinguishing their usage as in-the-moment awareness tools from instruments used after the fact to apportion credit and blame. We argue that representations like meters may be enough to provoke initial questions about fairness, but are likely to undermine the efforts of collaborators if they fail to combine a set of indices that reflect important aspects of individual work in the context of team activity. We consider broader lessons for the way in which future designs might aim to support fairness in collaborative systems, pointing to multidimensional mechanisms adapted specifically to real-time or retrospective usage. © 2016 ACM.","Awareness; Fairness; Social coordination; World of warcraft","Computer supported cooperative work; Interactive computer graphics; Interactive computer systems; Internet; Real time systems; Social networking (online); Visualization; Awareness; Collaborative systems; Collaborative Work; Fairness; In-depth interviews; Multidimensional mechanisms; Social coordination; World of Warcraft; Groupware","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGCHI; et al.; Facebook; Intel; Microsoft Research; National Science Foundation","19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing, CSCW 2016","27 February 2016 through 2 March 2016","San Francisco","119805","","978-145033592-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84963589455"

Motivated by the shuffled AUC metric in this paper, we propose a robust AUC metric that uses the statistical analysis of the fixations data to better judge the goodness of the different saliency algorithms. To calculate the robust AUC metric, we use the first eigenvector obtained from the statistical analysis to define the area from which non-fixations are selected thus mitigating the effect of the center bias. Our results show that the proposed metric results in similar performance when compared with the shuffled AUC metric, but given that the proposed metric is derived from the statistics for the data set, we believe that it is more robust.

They typically lead to an abstraction of the input data, images, or video, for further processing, such as clustering and machine learning. In clustering applications, the cluster center represents the prototypical descriptor of the cluster and estimates the corresponding signal value, such as color value or dominating flow orientation, by decoding the prototypical descriptor. Machine learning applications determine the relevance of respective descriptors and a visualization of the corresponding decoded information is very useful for the analysis of the learning algorithm. Thus decoding of feature descriptors is a relevant problem, frequently addressed in recent work. Also, the human brain represents sensorimotor information at a suitable abstraction level through varying activation of neuron populations. In previous work, computational models have been derived that agree with findings of neurophysiological experiments on the representation of visual information by decoding the underlying signals. However, the represented variables have a bias toward centers or boundaries of the tuning curves. Despite the fact that feature descriptors in computer vision are motivated from neuroscience, the respective decoding methods have been derived largely independent. From first principles, we derive unbiased decoding schemes for biologically motivated feature descriptors with a minimum amount of redundancy and suitable invariance properties. These descriptors establish a non-parametric density estimation of the underlying stochastic process with a particular algebraic structure. Based on the resulting algebraic constraints, we show formally how the decoding problem is formulated as an unbiased maximum likelihood estimator and we derive a recurrent inverse diffusion scheme to infer the dominating mode of the distribution. These methods are evaluated in experiments, where stationary points and bias from noisy image data are compared to existing methods. © 2015 Felsberg, öfjäll and Lenz.","Bias; Channel representations; Decoding; Feature descriptors; LenzEstimation; Population codes; Visualization","","Frontiers Media S.A.","","","","","","22969144","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84991513915"

This solution, when opaque primitives are used, results in high levels of occlusion, especially with dense streamline seeding. Using semi-transparent geometry primitives can alleviate the problem of occlusion. However, with semi-transparency some parts of the data set become too vague and blurry, while others are still heavily occluded. We conducted a user study that provided us with results on perceptual limits of using semi-transparent geometry primitives for flow visualization. Texture models for semi-transparent streamlines were introduced. Test subjects were shown multiple overlaying layers of streamlines and recorded how many different flow directions they were able to perceive. The user study allowed us to identify a set of top scoring textures. We discuss the results of the user study, provide guidelines on using semi-transparency for three-dimensional flow visualization and show how varying textures for different streamlines can further enhance the perception of dense streamlines. We also discuss the strategies for dealing with very high levels of occlusion. The strategies are per-pixel filtering of flow directions, when only some of the streamlines are rendered at a particular pixel, and opacity normalization, a way of altering the opacity of overlapping streamlines with the same direction. We illustrate our results with a variety of visualizations. © 2013 The Authors Computer Graphics Forum © 2013 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","perception; texture; visualization","Geometry; Opacity; Pixels; Sensory perception; Textures; Three dimensional computer graphics; Transparency; Visualization; Data set; Flow direction; Semi transparencies; Semi-transparent; Texture models; Three-dimensional flow; User study; Flow visualization","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","01677055","","CGFOD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84894546479"

In many cases this interior cavity is the most important feature of the surface. Applying standard blended transparency can reveal some of the hidden structure, but often results in confusion due to impaired surface-shape perception. We present ambient occlusion opacity mapping (AOOM), a novel visualization technique developed to improve understanding of the interior of molecular structures. Ambient occlusion is a shading method used in computer graphics that approximates complex shadows from an ambient light source by rendering objects darker when surrounded by other objects. Although ambient occlusion has previously been applied in molecular visualization to better understand surface shape, we instead use ambient occlusion information to determine a variable opacity at each point on the molecular surface. In this manner, AOOM enables rendering interior structures more opaque than outer structures, displaying the inner surface of interest more effectively than with constant-opacity blending. Furthermore, AOOM works for cases not handled by previous cavity-extraction techniques. This work has been driven by collaborators studying enzyme-ligand interactions, in which the active site of the enzyme is typically formed as a cavity in the molecular surface. In this paper we describe the AOOM technique and extensions, using visualization of the active site of enzymes as the driving problem.","Ambient occlusion; Molecular visualization; Transparent surfaces","","","","","","","","12136964","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79952940425"

Such visualization usually uses the polygon graphics, where the polygons must be sorted along the line of sight. The sorting, however, requires long computation time for largescale data. Besides order of polygons in the sorting often becomes indefinite especially for intersecting surfaces. On the other hand, the particle-based volume rendering was proposed as a transparent-rendering method which does not require sorting. In addition, the important feature of this method is to generate the particles first only once.

However, little research has been reported on the evaluation of their effectiveness. We present a user study that evaluates the perceptual effectiveness of six (four new and two existing) isosurface rendering-based uncertainty visualization techniques. For every technique, we consider its four effectiveness aspects: identification of the data, identification of the uncertainty, visual overload and brightness. There are thirty users participated in the user study and statistical analysis has been made for this study. Our analysis suggested that the two existing uncertainty visualization techniques appear to be the most advantageous in all the evaluated techniques. Both of them have high scores in all the four aspects of the effectiveness. In terms of the new techniques, the transparency technique appears to be the most promising. Whilst the remaining three new techniques may have some utility in certain aspects of the effectiveness, they are less useful in other aspects of the effectiveness. Additionally, a surprising result we have found is that adding auxiliary grid lines as background is not guaranteed to enhance the participants' perception to the errors depicted by the transparency. Conversely, it may lead to visual overload that increases the difficulty to recognize data. We believe that these findings can be useful for future uncertainty visualization design. © The Eurographics Association 2013.","","Data visualization; Transparency; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Grid line; Iso surface; Scalar data; Uncertainty visualization; User study; Rendering (computer graphics)","Eurographics Association","","2013 11th EG UK Theory and Practice of Computer Graphics Conference, TPCG 2013","5 September 2013 through 6 September 2013","Bath","160573","","978-390567398-2","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090670334"

The trust network visualization is a key to explore the mechanism of trust propagation and study the trust evaluation. Most existing network visualization approaches only take into account the undirected and unweighted graphs, which cannot illustrate the asymmetry and the discreteness of trust relationships. To solve this issue, we define the public influence weight, the trust strength and the trust distance in this paper and propose the force-directed visualization algorithm for trust network. In the visualization algorithm, the desirable length between two nodes is determined by the trust strength so as to cluster trusted entities, and the forces between two different nodes are determined by their public influence weights so as to center on the heavyweight entities. Finally, the visualization experiments are carried out on the Epinions data set and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the classical force-directed layout algorithm. The experimental results show that it can reveal the nature of communities better. © 2013 IEEE.","force-directed algorithms; layout techniques; trust distance; Trust network","Virtual reality; Visualization; World Wide Web; Force directed algorithms; Force-directed layout; layout techniques; Network visualization; trust distance; Trust networks; Visualization algorithms; Visualization experiment; Clustering algorithms","IEEE Computer Society","China Computer Federation; Chinese Computer Federation; IEEE Computer Society; Technical Committee of Office Automation of","2013 10th Web Information System and Application Conference, WISA 2013","1 November 2013 through 3 November 2013","Yangzhou, Jiangsu","104623","","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84899120241"

However, we have yet to develop visualization techniques that optimally convey the inner structure of complex transparent shapes. In this paper, we apply the findings of perception research to develop a novel illustrative rendering method that enhances surface transparency nonlocally. Rendering of transparent geometry is computationally expensive since many optimizations, such as visibility culling, are not applicable and fragments have to be sorted by depth for correct blending. In order to overcome these difficulties efficiently, we propose the illustration buffer. This novel data structure combines the ideas of the A and G-buffers to store a list of all surface layers for each pixel. A set of local and nonlocal operators is then used to process these depth-lists to generate the final image. Our technique is interactive on current graphics hardware and is only limited by the available graphics memory. Based on this framework, we present an efficient algorithm for a nonlocal transparency enhancement that creates expressive renderings of transparent surfaces. A controlled quantitative double blind user study shows that the presented approach improves the understanding of complex transparent surfaces significantly. © 1995-2012 IEEE.","a-buffer; diffusion; flow visualization; illustration buffer; Illustrative rendering; integral surface; perception; transparency; user study","Algorithms; Computer Graphics; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Reproducibility of Results; Rheology; Sensitivity and Specificity; User-Computer Interface; Algorithms; Blending; Computer graphics; Data structures; Diffusion; Sensory perception; Transparency; a-buffer; illustration buffer; Illustrative rendering; Integral surfaces; User study; algorithm; article; computer assisted diagnosis; computer graphics; computer interface; flow kinetics; image enhancement; methodology; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; three dimensional imaging; Flow visualization","","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84875624963"

First, we report the results of our controlled experiment in which collaborative traces were visualized. Second, we present an overview of tools which aim to represent collaborative software engineering traces. Our experiment provides evidence that collaborative traces can support the development of several factors of trust identified in our field study. However, we also identified some shortcomings of our current visualizations, gaining insights into future improvements. From our review of tools that represent collaborative traces, we observed that such representations can drive the design of tools that aim to support trust.

We also investigate the nature of confirmation biases in using sequence logos in result reporting in publications. While sequence logos have been widely used for visualizing sequence motifs in the past 20 years, no study has reported its effectiveness and possible misuses in decision making. We conducted a paper-and-pencil test to determine the effectiveness of sequence logos in some of their common usages. A survey study was also performed to investigate sequence logos' learn ability. We found that there are great mismatches between users' perception and actual quality of motifs when sequence logos were used as an evaluation metric. Therefore, evaluation of motif prediction tools based on sequence logos has to be interpreted cautiously. Our result also suggests that there are still room for improvements in the current sequence logo's layout design. © 2013 IEEE.","Confirmation bias; Motif visualization; Sequence logo","Computer graphics; Tools; Biological sequences; Confirmation bias; Evaluation metrics; Layout designs; Prediction tools; Sequence logos; Sequence motifs; Users' perception; Visualization","IEEE Computer Society","","10th International Conference Computer Graphics, Imaging, and Visualization, CGIV 2013","6 August 2013 through 8 August 2013","Macau","102028","","978-076955051-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84892655085"

This is especially the case when dealing with rare diseases where a lack of data, information and/or sharing of expertise can cause delays in progressing the understanding and potential diagnosis/treatment of such diseases. Research into adrenal tumours is one such area where co-ordination of international cancer efforts is essential. The European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours - Structuring clinical research on adrenal cancers in adults (ENS@T-CANCER) project has recently been funded by the European Union to establish a state of the art Virtual Research Environment (VRE) supporting all aspects of international research and collaboration into the aetiology, diagnosis and establishing optimal treatment strategies for patients with adrenal cancer. It is envisaged that this VRE will comprise a portfolio of clinical databases for the different types of adrenal tumours that exist; support and integrate a seamless federation of adrenal tumour bio-banks with support for bio-sample tracking; support a wide range of -omics research into adrenal tumours and allow results to be shared amongst collaborators; offer advanced visualization services, and support several large-scale clinical trials comprising cohorts of patients with different kinds/treatments of adrenal tumours. This paper outlines the goals of the ENS@T-CANCER project and outlines the on-going implementation work. We show how security-oriented information can be collected and tracked through the VRE including supporting collection of clinical data sets and their linkage with associated bio-samples in an ethically-driven framework. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Adrenal tumours; Biobanks; Ethics; Virtual research environments","Arts computing; Diagnosis; Diseases; Patient treatment; Tumors; Visualization; Adrenal tumours; Bio-samples; Biobanks; Cancer research; Clinical data; Clinical database; Clinical research; Clinical trial; Ethics; European networks; European Union; International researches; Optimal treatment; Rare disease; Research areas; State of the art; Virtual research environment; Research","","Elsevier B.V.; University Tsukuba, Center for Computational Sciences","11th International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS 2011","1 June 2011 through 3 June 2011","Singapore","85086","18770509","","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79958263709"

This article explores the impact of trust information visualization on mobile application usage with a three-stage experiment conducted in both Finland and China (1) by studying users' opinions on the importance of mobile applications, (2) by evaluating the impact of a trust indicator on mobile application usage, and (3) by evaluating the impact of a trust/reputation indicator on mobile application usage. Although the results achieved in this study for Finland and China showed small differences on usage willingness and remarkable difference on trust information check willingness, both countries indicated that visualizing the reputation value of an application and/or the individual trust value of a user can assist in mobile application usage with different importance rates. In addition, the article discusses possible reasons for the difference in impact in Finland and China, other impact factors related to mobile application usage, and implications of our experiments with regard to a trust management system for mobile applications. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.","Human-computer trust interaction; Mobile application; Reputation; Trust; Trust/reputation visualization","Computer applications; Experiments; Information analysis; Information systems; Decrease complexity; Human-computer trust interaction; Impact factor; Information visualization; Mobile applications; Reputation; Trust; Trust management systems; Mobile computing","","","","","","","16174909","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84883464797"

In this paper two new voxel-based applications are proposed to take advantage of this new functionality for interactively rendering realistic lighting effects including shadow of objects with complex occlusion and refraction and transmission of transparent objects. An absorption coefficient is computed according to the number of surface drawing in each voxel during voxelization and used to compute the amount of light passing through partial occluded complex objects. The refraction and transmission of light passing through transparent objects is simulated by our multiple refraction algorithm using surface normal, transmission coefficient and refraction index in each voxel. All these applications can generate the result in real-time without any preprocessing step. Additionally, we also found that the newly available geometry shader can be used to transform a highly complex surface-represented scene into a set of high-resolution voxels in only one GPU pass. This possibly improve the efficiency of the voxelization process. © The Eurographics Association 2011.","","Light transmission; Rendering (computer graphics); Textures; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3D textures; Absorption coefficients; Encoding and decoding; Graphics hardware; Hardware settings; Lighting effects; Real- time; Realistic Lighting; Transparent objects; Voxelization; Refraction","IEEE Computer Society","","19th Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications, PG 2011","21 September 2011 through 23 September 2011","Kaohsiung","174952","15504085","978-390567384-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983364936"

We seek to create guidelines for presenting such structures through experimental studies to define boundary conditions for visual intrusiveness. We base our work on the practice of designers, who use transparency to integrate overlaid grids with their underlying imagery. Previous work discovered a useful range of alpha values for black or white grids overlayed on scatterplot images rendered in shades of gray over gray backgrounds of different lightness values. This work compares black grids to blue and red ones on different image types of scatterplots and maps. We expected that the coloured grids over grayscale images would be more visually salient than black ones, resulting in lower alpha values. Instead, we found that there was no significant difference between the boundaries set for red and black grids, but that the boundaries for blue grids were set consistently higher (more opaque). As in our previous study, alpha values are affected by image density rather than image type, and are consistently lower than many default settings. These results have implications for the design of subtle reference structures. © 2011 IEEE.","applied perception; automated presentation; computational aesthetics; Information visualization; visual design","Design; Information systems; Visualization; Applied perception; automated presentation; computational aesthetics; Information visualization; Visual design; Transparency","","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80855139067"

Particularly, trust relations can play a key role to help nodes make decisions on service discoveries in wireless environments. Visualizing trust relations can help us understand and analyze the real-time threats that the distributed system is facing and consequently identify the attacks in order to deploy corresponding countermeasures. The main challenges to visualize trust in such distributed environments are as follows: (i) visually reorganizing and presenting trust relations to show underlying cooperation between attackers; (ii) mapping attacker behaviors to visual patterns in an ambiguity-free manner; (iii) properly organizing and encoding other contextual information to analyze how these factors play along with trust. In this paper, we introduce TrustVis, a tool that helps users visually analyze trust relations to identify attacks in a semi-automatic fashion. In parallel with a running trust evaluation engine that actively monitors trust relations, TrustVis reorganizes and presents trust relations with a matrix to map the cooperative attack schemes to visual patterns. By coordinating the trust matrix and other contextual information into a multi-faceted view, TrustVis incorporates the intelligence of domain experts to interactively monitor the networked system toward identifying both the attackers' identities and the adopted attack schemes. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Security visualization; Trust management; Visual analysis","Matrix algebra; Contextual information; Distributed computing environment; Distributed environments; Distributed systems; Security visualization; Trust management; Visual analysis; Wireless environment; Distributed computer systems","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","","","","","","19390114","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888414316"

Its main feature is the combination of Lie group transformations with human perception rules that makes restoration more flexible and adaptive to defects having different physical or mechanical causes. Specifically, Lie groups allow to define a redundant set of transformations from which it is possible to automatically select the ones that better invert the physical formation of the defect. Hence, the restoration process consists of an iterative procedure whose main goal is to reduce defect visual perception. The proposed restoration method has been successfully tested on original movies and photographs, affected by line-scratches and semi-transparent blotches.","Human visual system; Image restoration; Lie groups; Semi-transparent defects","Computer graphics; Image reconstruction; Iterative methods; Lie groups; Restoration; Visualization; Generalized models; Human Visual System; Lie group transformation; Perception-based; Restoration methods; Restoration process; Semi-transparent; Visual perception; Defects","Vaclav Skala - Union Agency","","20th International Conference in Central Europe on Computer Graphics, Visualization and Computer Vision, WSCG 2012","26 June 2012 through 28 June 2012","Plzen","99298","","978-808694379-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884169777"

To obtain the representative measurement effectively, we calculate the dissimilarity in a reduced dimensional principal component space. In addition, our method may be easily extended for more conspicuous feature channels in an efficient manner.

Visualization of those detailed models is an important part of the scientific workflow, allowing domain scientists to inspect and analyze the models as a virtual tissue. However, these visualizations pose several computational and interface challenges, from issues such as data size and geometrical and visual complexity. Manual or query driven selection of visual attributes such as color, transparency, transfer functions, visibility are important components for the usability of those visualizations, yet this requires the rendering to be as responsive as possible. Given the data complexity (several million triangles) - despite the power of current GPUs - parallel rendering is the only choice to visualize the full circuits at interactive levels. In particular, sort-first is an appropriate choice to deal with transparency, however it requires efficient view frustum culling. This paper presents two novel techniques for view frustum culling based on a bounding volume skeleton which is created from the geometrical skeleton of the neurons. These skeletons are combined with spatial partitions and some GPU processing to extract the portions of the neurons that need to be rendered while still facilitating interactive changes in the attributes. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better results than classical approaches such as OBB-trees and looks promising for sort-first environments. © 2012 IEEE.","Cortical neuron simulation visualization; view frustum culling","Data visualization; Digital storage; Musculoskeletal system; Neurons; Program processors; Tissue; Transparency; Visualization; Bounding volume; Brain research; Classical approach; Cortical neurons; Data complexity; Data size; Detailed models; GPU processing; Neural tissue; Neural tissue models; Novel techniques; Parallel rendering; Real time visualization; Scientific workflows; View frustum culling; Visual attributes; Visual complexity; Three dimensional computer graphics","","IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC)","2nd IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization, BioVis 2012","14 October 2012 through 19 October 2012","Seattle, WA","94841","","978-146734730-3","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84872260706"

We hold that a compliance methodology should take into account ""shared"" relevant laws and a requirements engineering framework. We reflect mainly on the view of enterprise architects on legal informatics and a vision driven approach on requirements elicitation in the context of enterprise engineering, which was proposed by Albertas Čaplinskas (2009).

In many cases this interior cavity is the most important feature of the surface. Applying standard blended transparency can reveal some of the hidden structure, but often results in confusion due to impaired surface-shape perception. We present ambient occlusion opacity mapping (AOOM), a novel visualization technique developed to improve understanding of the interior of molecular structures. Ambient occlusion is a shading method used in computer graphics that approximates complex shadows from an ambient light source by rendering objects darker when surrounded by other objects. Although ambient occlusion has previously been applied in molecular visualization to better understand surface shape, we instead use ambient occlusion information to determine a variable opacity at each point on the molecular surface. In this manner, AOOM enables rendering interior structures more opaque than outer structures, displaying the inner surface of interest more effectively than with constant-opacity blending. Furthermore, AOOM works for cases not handled by previous cavity-extraction techniques. This work has been driven by collaborators studying enzyme-ligand interactions, in which the active site of the enzyme is typically formed as a cavity in the molecular surface. In this paper we describe the AOOM technique and extensions, using visualization of the active site of enzymes as the driving problem.","Ambient occlusion; Molecular visualization; Transparent surfaces","Blending; Computer graphics; Enzymes; Light sources; Molecular structure; Opacity; Visualization; Active site; Ambient light; Ambient occlusion; Enzyme-ligand interactions; Hidden structures; Inner surfaces; Interior structure; Molecular surfaces; Molecular visualization; Surface shape; Transparent surfaces; Visualization technique; Computer vision","","","19th International Conference in Central Europe on Computer Graphics, Visualization and Computer Vision, WSCG 2011","31 January 2011 through 3 February 2011","Plzen","89892","","978-808694383-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861327843"

This quality is awkward especially if it comes to applications in security or safety-sensitive areas. Here a step towards more trustful systems could be taken by providing transparency of the processes of a system. An important means of giving feedback to an operator is the visualization of the internal processes of a system. In this position paper we address the problem of visualizing dynamic processes especially in self-learning systems. We take an existing self-learning system from the field of computer vision as an example from which we derive questions of general interest such as possible options to visualize the flow of information in a dynamic learning system or the visualization of symbolic data. As a side effect the visualization of learning processes may provide a better understanding of underlying principles of learning in general, i.e, also in biological systems. That may also facilitate improved designs of future self-learning systems. © 2012 IEEE.","self-learning systems; symbolic representations; transparency and controllability of self-organization processes; Visualization of dynamic processes","Computer vision; Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Transparency; Visualization; Dynamic learning; Dynamic process; Learning process; Position papers; Self learning system; Self-learning; Self-organization process; Self-organizing systems; Side effect; Symbolic data; Symbolic representation; Underlying principles; Data visualization","","","2012 10th Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust, PST 2012","16 July 2012 through 18 July 2012","Paris","93395","","978-146732326-0","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84868241181"

However, these methods typically rely on humans instead of automatic extraction techniques. Futhermore, there is little discussion regarding the role of user frustration when interacting with a visual interface. We demonstrate that automatic extraction of user frustration is possible given action-level visualization interaction logs. An experiment is described which collects data that accurately reflects user emotion transitions and corresponding interaction sequences. This data is then used in building HiddenMarkov Models (HMMs) which statistically connect interaction events with frustration. The capabilities of HMMs in predicting user frustration are tested using standard machine learning evaluation methods. The resulting classifer serves as a suitable predictor of user frustration that performs similarly across different users and datasets. © 2011 IEEE.","K.6.1 [Management of Computing and Information Systems]: Project and People Management - Life Cycle; K.7.m [The Computing Profession]: Miscellaneous - Ethics","Graphical user interfaces; Technology; Visualization; Automatic extraction; Data sets; Evaluation Method; In-buildings; K.7.m [The Computing Profession]: Miscellaneous - Ethics; People management; Standard machines; User emotions; Visual analytics; Visual Interface; Information management","","IEEE Comput.

This paper explores the effects of trust information's visualization on mobile application usage in Finland and China with three steps: (1) Studying users' opinion on mobile application's importance. (2) Evaluating a trust indicator's effect on mobile application usage. (3) Evaluating a trust/reputation indicator's effect on mobile application usage. Although the results achieved in above two countries showed differences, both indicated that displaying an application's reputation value and/or a user's individual trust value could assist in the usage of mobile applications with different importance.

Typically, these systems offer users interactive visualizations that allow meaningful exploration of the data. Through this exploration, PI systems have great potential to facilitate self-reflection and encourage behavior change. One of the challenges facing PI systems is a general lack of transparency about the uncertainty, noise or measurement error in the information they display. Data acquisition, processing/inference, and wireless transmission, can each inject errors into the data. However, most PI systems do not provide a way to help users understand what types of errors could be in the data, where these errors come from, and to what extent they can trust the data they see is correct.

In this study, we proposed a visual saliency model to predict eye movements during free viewing of videos. The model is inspired by the biology of the visual system and breaks down each frame of a video database into three saliency maps, each earmarked for a particular visual feature. (a) A 'static' saliency map emphasizes regions that differ from their context in terms of luminance, orientation and spatial frequency. (b) A 'dynamic' saliency map emphasizes moving regions with values proportional to motion amplitude. (c) A 'face' saliency map emphasizes areas where a face is detected with a value proportional to the confidence of the detection. In parallel, a behavioral experiment was carried out to record eye movements of participants when viewing the videos. These eye movements were compared with the models' saliency maps to quantify their efficiency. We also examined the influence of center bias on the saliency maps and incorporated it into the model in a suitable way. Finally, we proposed an efficient fusion method of all these saliency maps. Consequently, the fused master saliency map developed in this research is a good predictor of participants' eye positions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Center bias; Dynamic features; Face features; Gaze prediction; Static features; Video; Visual saliency model","Face recognition; Image segmentation; Object recognition; Visualization; Center bias; Dynamic features; Face features; Static features; Video; Visual saliency model; Eye movements","","","","","","","18669964","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84874567662"

The main goal of the present paper is to suggest a collaboration in creating and supporting an open database of tests. To prepare a real scene with a crystal specimen, to photograph it, and to describe the corresponding virtual scene is a complex problem. Obviously this is an almost impossible task for many devolopers of rendering algorithms. Well-known examples of translucent media are crystals. They are convenient for testing purposes as they have permanent solid shapes. Although the crystals are rendered by a recursive ray tracing algorithm, the tests considered in the paper can be applied to other algorithms.","Anisotropic media; Birefringence; Crystal; Optical dispersion; Pleochroism; Polarized light; Ray tracing; Rendering algorithm; Test repository; Validation; Verification","Anisotropic media; Birefringence; Computer graphics; Crystals; Light polarization; Ray tracing; Verification; Visualization; Complex problems; Optical dispersion; Pleochroism; Ray-tracing algorithm; Rendering algorithms; Translucent objects; Transparent objects; Validation; Algorithms","","","20th International Conference in Central Europe on Computer Graphics, Visualization and Computer Vision, WSCG 2012","26 June 2012 through 28 June 2012","Plzen","99298","","978-808694379-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884188058"

We want the presentation of these structures in complex, dynamic, computer-generated visualizations to reflect the same subtlety and comfort of good design. Our goal is to determine the physical, perceptual, and cognitive characteristics of such structures in a way that enables automatic presentation. Our approach to this problem does not try to characterize ""ideal or ""best, but instead seeks boundary conditions that define a range of visible yet subtle legibility. All presentations that are clearly bad lie outside of this range, and can easily be avoided. In this paper, we report three experiments investigating the effects of grid color and spacing on these boundary conditions, defined by manipulating the transparency (alpha) of thin rectangular grids over scatter plots. Our results show that while there is some variation due to user preference and image properties, bounding alpha allows us to reliably predict a range of usable yet unobtrusive grids over a wide variety of conditions. © 2011 IEEE.","applied perception; automated presentation; Index TermsInformation visualization; visual design.","Boundary conditions; Design; Visualization; Applied perception; automated presentation; Cognitive characteristics; Contour line; Image properties; Index TermsInformation visualization; Know-how; Rectangular grids; Scatter plots; Visual design; Visual elements; Transparency","","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80051689657"

The Ratio of Equivalent Transparency (Req) is a basic index for assessing whether a building is energy-efficient. Req is the ratio of the area of total building envelope and the area of envelope equivalent transparency. Calculation of Req requires not simply the consideration of natural factors such as building location, direction, ambient lighting and sunshine, but also and physical factors such as material, structure, ventilation and sunshade. Furthermore, Req is considered particularly applicable due to the ubiquity of terraced houses in Taiwan, given the country's high population density. In this study, the correction factor to include the effect of party walls is added into the formula of Req calculation to prevent distortions to the area calculation of the building envelope. Current practices in Taiwan of manually calculating Req render the results prone to error, and are also time-consuming. To address these issues, this research developed a visual Req calculation tool based on a 3D environment. This system provides users with various visualization tools to view the status and Req results of the building project. Furthermore, object-oriented modeling and parametric design can shorten the time taken to look-up tables and simplify the process of Req calculation, and also help to reduce computation time and errors.","3D models; Energy saving; Green building; Req; Visualization","Energy conservation; Flow visualization; Intelligent buildings; Population statistics; Robotics; Solar buildings; Table lookup; Three dimensional; Transparency; Visualization; 3-D environments; 3D models; Ambient lighting; Area calculation; Building envelopes; Building projects; Calculation tools; Computation time; Correction factors; Energy efficient; Energy-saving buildings; Green buildings; High population density; Look up table; Natural factors; Objectoriented modeling; Parametric design; Physical factors; Req; Terraced house; Visualization tools; Structural design","","","28th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2011","29 June 2011 through 2 July 2011","Seoul","91063","","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863733606"

This presents a challenge for volume rendering methods to produce images with unambiguous depth-ordering perception. Existing methods use visual cues such as halos and shadows to enhance depth perception. Along with other limitations, these methods introduce redundant information and require additional overhead. This paper presents a new approach to enhancing depth-ordering perception of volume rendered images without using additional visual cues. We set up an energy function based on quantitative perception models to measure the quality of the images in terms of the effectiveness of depth-ordering and transparency perception as well as the faithfulness of the information revealed.

Thus, selection of genetic data with desired properties, such as evolutionary representation or shared genotypes, is problematic. Selection on the basis of epidemiological variables may not achieve the desired properties. Available automated approaches to the selection of influenza genetic data make a tradeoff between speed and simplicity on the one hand and control over quality and contents of the dataset on the other hand. A poorly chosen dataset may be detrimental to subsequent analyses.Results: We developed a tool, Tree Pruner, for obtaining a dataset with desired evolutionary properties from a large, biased genetic database. Tree Pruner provides the user with an interactive phylogenetic tree as a means of editing the initial dataset from which the tree was inferred. The tree visualization changes dynamically, using colors and shading, reflecting Tree Pruner actions. At the end of a Tree Pruner session, the editing actions are implemented in the dataset.Currently, Tree Pruner is implemented on the Influenza Research Database (IRD). The data management capabilities of the IRD allow the user to store a pruned dataset for additional pruning or for subsequent analysis. Tree Pruner can be easily adapted for use with other organisms.Conclusions: Tree Pruner is an efficient, manual tool for selecting a high-quality dataset with desired evolutionary properties from a biased database of genetic sequences. It offers an important alternative to automated approaches to the same goal, by providing the user with a dynamic, visual guide to the ongoing selection process and ultimate control over the contents (and therefore quality) of the dataset. © 2011 Krishnamoorthy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Computational Biology; Data Mining; Database Management Systems; Databases, Genetic; Phylogeny; Selection Bias; Software; Communication channels (information theory); Database systems; Information management; Quality control; Tools; Automated approach; Genetic sequence; High quality; Large database; Management capabilities; Phylogenetic trees; Research database; Tree visualization; article; biology; computer program; data base; data mining; epidemiology; genetic database; methodology; phylogeny; Trees (mathematics)","","","","","","","14712105","","BBMIC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-79651471272"

When seeing a volume visualization result, persons with CVD may be incapable of discriminating the classification information expressed in the image if the color transfer function or the color blending used in the direct volume rendering is not appropriate. Conventional methods used to address this problem adopt advanced image recoloring techniques to enhance the rendering results frame-by-frame; unfortunately, problematic perceptual results may still be generated. This paper proposes an alternative solution that complements the image recoloring scheme by reconfiguring the components of the direct volume rendering (DVR) pipeline. Our approach optimizes the mapped colors of a transfer function to simulate CVD-friendly effect that is generated by applying the image recoloring to the results with the initial transfer function. The optimization process has a low computational complexity, and only needs to be performed once for a given transfer function. To achieve detail-preserving and perceptually natural semi-transparent effects, we introduce a new color composition mode that works in the color space of dichromats. Experimental results and a pilot study demonstrates that our approach can yield dichromats-friendly and consistent volume visualization in real-time. © 2011 IEEE.","Dichromacy; direct volume rendering; image recoloring; volume classification","Algorithms; Color; Color Vision Defects; Computer Graphics; Databases, Factual; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Phantoms, Imaging; User-Computer Interface; Blending; Color; Color image processing; Color vision; Computational complexity; Visualization; Volume rendering; Color composition; Color space; Color vision deficiencies; Color-blending; Conventional methods; Dichromacy; Dichromats; Direct volume rendering; image recoloring; Optimization process; Pilot studies; Recoloring; Semi-transparent; volume classification; Volume visualization; algorithm; article; color; color vision defect; computer graphics; computer interface; evaluation; factual database; human; image quality; statistics; three dimensional imaging; Transfer functions","","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80855124982"

[1] to full color images. Yamamoto's technique makes use of black and transparent mask as decoding shadow image of a visual cryptography scheme sharing 3 bits multi-color messages. By combining perspective setup together with a color visual cryptography (VC) scheme which does not use any mask, we can securely display color images. A satisfying color VC scheme is used which can be printed on a transparency film. When printed, colors act as filters [2] and allow a wider color gamut for the message which is not limited to saturated color as in [1] because of the black and transparent mask as decoding shadow image. In our implementation of the two-out-of-two visual cryptography scheme which shares a secret message into two color shadow images, the first one is projected onto a glass diffuser and the second one is printed on a transparency. A registration method is used in order to overcome the difficulty of shadow image alignment. As the two shadow images are superposed with an air layer, the message disappears when the angular position is not close to the ideal one. Examples with binary colored messages and with color images are provided to show the extension. By moving the detector (or the eyes) angularly around the right position, perspective effects can be perceived. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","color image; viewing zone; visual cryptography","Color image processing; Cryptography; Decoding; Imaging systems; Transparency; Visualization; Air layers; Angular positions; Color gamuts; Color images; Full color images; Information display; Multi-colors; Registration methods; Saturated colors; Secret messages; Shadow images; Transparency films; Two-color; Viewing zone; Visual cryptography; Visual cryptography schemes; Color","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Three-Dimensional Imaging, Visualization, and Display 2012","24 April 2012 through 25 April 2012","Baltimore, MD","91517","0277786X","978-081949062-9","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864366274"

Since the basic Semantic Web infrastructure is reaching sufficient maturity, research efforts are shifting towards logic, proof and trust and rule-based systems inevitably concentrate most of the attention. Nevertheless, in order for human users to trust system answers, they have to be presented with adequate explanations that justify the derived results. And, even more importantly, these explanations have to be presented in a user-comprehensible format. Consequently, the focus in this work is on humans and the research area called proof visualization that features three main approaches: tree-based, graphical and logical/textual. Since each of the approaches presents advantages and disadvantages, this article proposes a fourth, hybrid visualization approach that combines the pros of all three approaches and attempts to leverage the respective cons. The article also presents a software tool that implements the proposed hybrid approach. The tool is called VProofH and visualizes defeasible logic proofs, offering multiple representations that adapt to user needs.

Three different tracer solutions of different viscosity were used in the study, and all tests were carried out at the same flow conditions. As expected, the viscosity of the tracer strongly influenced the mixing in the pipe and the resulting dye plume was used to indicate tracer dispersion.

Appropriate ways to intuitively visualize uncertainties are therefore critical to draw appropriate decisions. However, empirical assessments of uncertainty visualization for decision making are currently limited to 2D map data, while most geological entities are either surfaces embedded in a 3D space or volumes.This paper first reviews a typical example of decision making under uncertainty, where uncertainty visualization methods can actually make a difference. This issue is illustrated on a real Middle East oil and gas reservoir, looking for the optimal location of a new appraisal well. In a second step, we propose a user study that goes beyond traditional 2D map data, using 2.5D pressure data for the purposes of well design. Our experiments study the quality of adjacent versus coincident representations of spatial uncertainty as compared to the presentation of data without uncertainty; the representations' quality is assessed in terms of decision accuracy.

Since mobile devices are nowadays almost omnipresent, it is possible to seamlessly integrate the educational process into daily life when using mobile learning concepts. Augmented reality (AR) can significantly increase the attractiveness of mobile learning applications by adding a new level of experience for learners and thus improving the learning situation. In addition, AR applications allow students to gain experience in areas where ethical constraints may have to be placed on learning the subject in a real-life scenario. In this paper, an application following this concept, called mARble, will be presented. It offers an augmented reality blended learning environment for mobile phones. Currently, content for a course in basic forensics is available, and in a pilot study, medical students will be equipped with smart phones with a preinstalled version of mARble that gives them the opportunity to practice the recognition of certain wound patterns by overlaying these wound patterns on their own skin in real-time. The application also contains supplemental material in the form of multimedia and textual content as well as questions and tasks concerning the presented wound patterns to further enhance the learning experience. The main objective of the project is to generate synergy effects in the learning process by combining the best of modern mobile learning concepts with a traditional learning setting. By using innovative visualization techniques within the presented application, students are provided with the means to interact in a role-playing setting within their group, and a demanding, but fascinating learning environment can be created.

The dissimilarity between image patches is evaluated in a reduced dimensional principal component space and is inversely weighted by the spatial separations between patches. An additional weighting mechanism is deployed that reflects the bias of human fixations towards the image center. The method is tested on three public image datasets and a video clip to evaluate its performance. The experimental results indicate highly competitive performance despite the simple definition of the proposed index. The conspicuity maps generated are more consistent with human fixations than prior state-of-the-art models when tested on color image datasets. This is demonstrated using both receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and the Kullback-Leibler distance metric. The method should prove useful for such diverse image processing tasks as quality assessment, segmentation, search, or compression. The high performance and relative simplicity of the conspicuity index relative to other much more complex models suggests that it may find wide usage. © 2006 IEEE.","central bias; conspicuity; dissimilarity; spatial distance; visual saliency","Data processing; Principal component analysis; Rating; Visualization; central bias; Conspicuity; dissimilarity; spatial distance; Visual saliency; Image segmentation","","","","","","","10709908","","ISPLE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80054685389"

Our approach is based on an enhanced tagging framework, called iT , where tags are enriched with structure and expressivity and can be addressed to different features of a resource and weighed by relevance. Our main contribution is a synthesis of the collective opinions that is multi-faceted: it shows different points of view on the same resource, rather than averaging the opposite opinions, or choosing the one with the most supporters. If the social tool provides user modeling and trust mechanisms, our synthesis can also be personalized, taking into account both the user's social network (considering only the opinions of trusted authors) and her user model (considering only the features the user likes). In addition, we propose an innovative visualization modality for iT s, which allows for an at-a-glance impression of all the opinions on a given resource, including significant differences in point of view. We evaluated the iT framework to test (i) its expressiveness for providing opinions, and (ii) the effectiveness of our synthesis with respect to traditional tag clouds. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","personalized synthesis; social web; tagging systems","Artificial intelligence; Mathematical models; Visualization; Artificial intelligence; Social context; Social Networks; social web; Tag-based; Tagging systems; Trust mechanism; User Modeling; User models; Social context; Social webs; Tag clouds; Tag-based; Tagging systems; Trust mechanism; User Modeling; User interfaces; User interfaces","","University of Palermo; Artificial Intelligence Journal by Elsevier; Istituto di Calcolo e Reti ad Alte Prestazioni (ICAR-CNR); Centro Interdipartimentale Tecnologie della Conoscenza (CITC); Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A.; Informamuse s.r.l.","12th International Conference of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence, AI*IA 2011","15 September 2011 through 17 September 2011","Palermo","86599","16113349","978-364223953-3","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-80053026673"

A between-group design experiment with 59 Swedish drivers was carried out where a continuous representation of the uncertainty of the car's ability to autonomously drive during snow conditions was displayed to one of the groups, whereas omitted for the control group. The results show that, on average, the group of drivers who were provided with the uncertainty representation took control of the car faster when needed, while they were, at the same time, the ones who spent more time looking at other things than on the road ahead. Thus, drivers provided with the uncertainty information could, to a higher degree, perform tasks other than driving without compromising with driving safety. The analysis of trust shows that the participants who were provided with the uncertainty information trusted the automated system less than those who did not receive such information, which indicates a more proper trust calibration than in the control group. © 2013 ACM.","acceptance; automation; driving; trust; uncertainty visualization","Automation; Calibration; User interfaces; acceptance; Design experiments; driving; System uncertainties; trust; Uncertainty informations; Uncertainty representation; Uncertainty visualization; Uncertainty analysis","","Eindhoven University of Technology,; Department of Industrial Design; ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human; Interaction (SIGCHI)","5th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, AutomotiveUI 2013","27 October 2013 through 30 October 2013","Eindhoven","100907","","978-145032478-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888184123"

Photography imaging became possible in the period of 19 century, it was a combination of several different scientific discoveries. Architectural photo imaging began with monochrome recording limitation, and the dynamic range recorded was inadequate even with analog color film. Often it was arguable if the photography image would provide reliable imagery information, either for aesthetic visualization purpose or to record accurate imagery information. The paper aims to analyze the limitations and issues that affect visual accuracy of HDR imaging digital workflow, including the environmental technical obstacles. Due to the situations of very contrast lighting condition, the extended dynamic range may be needed for archiving the real-world scene of architectural subject.

An optical microscope was used with an ultra-high-speed camera to capture the motion of particles suspended in a transparent liquid at the center of the nozzle and above the fluid meniscus at a rate of half a million frames per second. Time-resolved velocity fields were obtained from a fluid layer approximately 200 μm thick within the nozzle for a complete jetting cycle.

In our proposed algorithm, two correlation planes are obtain first, one with values higher and the another with values smaller than the true sub-pixel displacement. The two correlation planes are then averaged with weights, which is obtained through analyzing the error distribution. Finally, three-point Gaussian interpolation in the new correlation plane provides more accurate sub-pixel displacement. The assessment of synthetic images in the uniform flow, Oseen vortex flow and standard target flow shows that the proposed method can achieve higher evaluation accuracy not only for uniform flows, but also for flows with large velocity magnitude and gradients.","Bias error; Correction method; Cross-correlation; Particle image velocimetry (PIV)","Algorithms; Correlation methods; Flow visualization; Pixels; Velocimeters; Velocity measurement; Vortex flow; Bias error; Compensation method; Correction method; Cross correlations; Error distributions; Evaluation accuracy; Gaussian interpolation; Interrogation algorithms; New correlations; Oseen vortex; Particle image velocimetries; Particle image velocimetry (PIV); Sub-pixel displacements; Synthetic images; Target flow; Uniform flow; Error compensation","","","","","","","10039775","","JFTXF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-82255193001"

A rigid spatial translation followed by low pass filtering yields a single frequency component of the image intensity.

However, raw data are dense and complex, lacking high-level descriptive power, thus revealing the need for the automatic detection of architectural objects, such as facades, windows, balconies, etc. In this paper, we describe novel algorithms for the detection of windows, which are ubiquitous in urban areas. Detecting isolated windows is a challenging problem due to the inability of the laser range sensors to acquire any data on transparent surfaces and due to the wide variability of window features. Our approach is based on the assumption that the elements (windows) are arranged in multiple unknown periodic structures making our system robust to single window detection errors. This kind of detection is essential for high-level recognition algorithms, compression methods, registration, as well as realistic visualizations. © 2012 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Computer vision; Three dimensional; Visualization; Automatic Detection; Compression methods; Laser range scanners; Laser range sensors; Novel algorithm; Point cloud; Recognition algorithm; Transparent surfaces; Urban areas; Urban environments; Urban scenes; Urban site; Window detection; Laser windows","","","2012 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops, CVPRW 2012","16 June 2012 through 21 June 2012","Providence, RI","91784","21607516","978-146731611-8","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84864995397"

PPP processes dual-frequency pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements from a single user receiver, using detailed physical models and corrections, and precise GNSS orbit and clock products calculated beforehand (for example products from IGS, the International GNSS Service). PPP is different from other precise-positioning approaches like RTK in that no reference stations are needed in the vicinity of the user receiver. The only observation data that must be processed are measurements from the user receiver. Another advantage of PPP is that since the GNSS orbit and clock products are by nature global, the PPP solutions are also global, i.e., the PPP approach works for a receiver located anywhere on or above the Earth surface, and the resulting position is referred to a well-known terrestrial reference frame (normally ITRF). PPP can be applied at post-processing level and also in real-time applications, provided that real-time input orbits and clocks are available. One disadvantage of standard PPP however is its relatively slow convergence time, which is of the order of an hour for decimetric accuracy, as compared to nearly instantaneous convergence with centimetric accuracy in short-baseline RTK. In 2008 GMV introduced magicGNSS, a web application for high-accuracy GNSS data processing. magicGNSS is available online at http://magicgnss.gmv.com. A free account can be requested online for a one-month trial period. A PPP software module is available in magicGNSS, allowing the user the post-processing of dual-frequency static and kinematic RINEX measurement files. The PPP module supports GPS and GLONASS data. Satellite orbits and clock products are calculated internally in a transparent way for the user. GMV has developed an infrastructure for the generation of precise GPS and GLONASS orbits and clocks with very low latency in a first step, and in real time in a second step. The products generated this way are contributed to the IGS Real Time Pilot Project, and are also used to feed the PPP service, part of the web application magicGNSS. The product generation is based on an Orbit Determination and Time Synchronisation (ODTS) process, which runs typically every 15 minutes. This process receives as input dual-frequency code and phase measurements collected in real time from a world-wide network of IGS stations, using the NTRIP protocol. Then, they are pre-processed also in real time by a Pre-processing and Validation module (PPV) and made available to the different algorithms. In parallel to the ODTS, another process estimates the clocks in real time taking as input the observations and the outputs from the last ODTS execution. There is a small latency in the delivery of the clock estimation, which is associated to the time that the algorithm waits for the arrival of the measurements from the station through the Internet, typically one or two seconds. The GPS and GLONASS satellites are processed together, in order to ensure a consistent solution. It is necessary to estimate an inter-channel bias when processing GLONASS data. This must be done in order to compensate for the different internal delays in the pseudorange measurements through the GLONASS receiver, associated to the different frequencies used by the different satellites. The real-time orbits and clocks are available as a data stream to real-time processing algorithms (such as real-time PPP), and stored in standard formats (SP3, clock RINEX) for offline use. In the near future the products will contain also additional clock biases to allow the resolution of integer carrier-phase ambiguities in PPP, for improved positioning accuracy and shorter convergence time. In parallel to the PPP product generation, GMV is developing a novel user terminal prototype for PPP, that can be connected to any GNSS receiver providing real-time raw measurements and navigation messages through a serial or USB port (in RTCM format), and can receive PPP orbit+clock corrections via GSM/GPRS (internet through mobile phone network) and also via Iridium (satellite based, with global coverage). This device is a self-contained, DC-powered case, containing mainly a Single Board Computer (SBC board) running Linux for the PPP client software, an additional board hosting the new Iridium 9602 modem, plus a LCD touch display for terminal control and visualization of results. The major advantage of this design is that the PPP user terminal can be connected to virtually any professional GNSS receiver in the market, since practically all of them are able to generate raw output in RTCM format via a serial or USB port. For remote locations without GSM/GPRS coverage, satellite communications via Iridium shall be used. The Iridium SBD service has a low, uniform global latency reported to be of the order of half a minute. PPP service via Iridium is based on clock corrections sent at a rate of one minute; this is believed to be a reasonable compromise between positioning performances and communications costs. This paper describes the implementation of GMVs infrastructure for real-time PPP products and their usage in the new user terminal.","","Algorithms; Clocks; Computer operating systems; Data handling; Estimation; Internet protocols; Iridium; Liquid crystal displays; Models; Navigation; Orbits; Phase measurement; Satellite communication systems; Satellites; Signal receivers; Visualization; World Wide Web; Carrier-phase measurement; Centimetric accuracy; Client software; Clock bias; Convergence time; Data stream; Different frequency; Dual frequency; Earth surface; Global coverage; GLONASS; Glonass receivers; GNSS receivers; GSM/GPRS; High-accuracy; Low latency; Mobile phone networks; Navigation messages; No references; Novel devices; Observation data; Offline; Orbit determination; Physical model; Pilot projects; Positioning accuracy; Positioning performance; Positioning techniques; Post processing; Pre-processing; Precise point positioning; Precise positioning; Product generation; Pseudorange; Pseudorange measurements; Raw measurements; Real time; Real-time application; Real-time orbits; Realtime processing; Remote location; Satellite communications; Satellite orbit; Single board computers; Single users; Software modules; Standard format; Terminal control; Terrestrial reference frame; Trial period; USB ports; User terminals; User-receiver; WEB application; World-wide networks; Global positioning system","","","24th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation 2011, ION GNSS 2011","19 September 2011 through 23 September 2011","Portland, OR","89839","","978-161839475-0","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84861408321"

The constant appeal for parliamentary openness regarding information on laws and bills and accountability of elected representatives calls for transparency in parliamentary procedures and at several areas of parliamentary informatics, in order to enhance democratic control and reestablish constituents’ trust. On the other hand, the provision of easy to understand and analyze information plays a central role to the achievement of transparency. In this respect, this paper provides an overview of the characteristics and capabilities of information visualization that can contribute to delineating the institutional, but also technical possibilities and constraints of achieving legislative transparency. On the basis of this overview, it is attempted to highlight some causal relationships between parliamentary openness, legislative transparency and parliamentary information visualization, and discuss the potential and limitations of PIV not only in terms of technical solutions but also with respect to human factors and political aspects that need to be considered as further determining the success or failure of PIV efforts. In this line of thought, the concluding section of the article provides a discussion on the strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats that can be identified for parliamentary information visualization, as well as on dimensions and specific checkpoints that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of PIV efforts, as regards the end objective of citizen empowerment. © 2020, International Journal on Emerging Technolgies.

First, the segmentation using the level set method was conducted through a surface evolution framework based on the geometric variation principle. This approach addresses the topological changes in the deformable surface by using the geometric integral measures and level set theory. These integral measures contain a robust alignment term, an active region term, and a mean curvature term. By using the level set method with a new hybrid speed function derived from the geometric integral measures, the accurate deformable surface can be extracted from a volumetric medical data set. Second, we employed a hybrid volume rendering approach to visualize the extracted deformable structures. Our method combines indirect and direct volume rendering techniques. Segmented objects within the data set are rendered locally by surface rendering on an object-by-object basis. Globally, all the results of subsequent object rendering are obtained by direct volume rendering (DVR). Then the two rendered results are finally combined in a merging step. This is especially useful when inner structures should be visualized together with semi-transparent outer parts. This merging step is similar to the focus-plus-context approach known from information visualization. Finally, we verified the accuracy and robustness of the proposed segmentation method for various medical volume images. The volume rendering results of segmented 3D objects show that our proposed method can accurately extract and visualize human organs from various multimodality medical volume images. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","Medical image; Volume rendering; Volume segmentation; Volume visualization","Computer vision; Deformation; Drop breakup; Geometry; Image segmentation; Imaging systems; Information systems; Level measurement; Merging; Numerical methods; Three dimensional; Visualization; Volume rendering; 3D object; Active regions; Anatomical structures; Data sets; Deformable structures; Deformable surfaces; Direct volume rendering; Geometric variations; Information visualization; Inner structure; Level Set method; Level set segmentation; Level set theory; Mean curvature; Medical data; Medical images; Multi-modality; Object rendering; Rendering approach; Segmentation methods; Segmented objects; Semi-transparent; Speed function; Surface evolution; Surface rendering; Topological changes; Volume image; Volume segmentation; Volume visualization; Medical imaging","","The Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS and T); The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Image Processing: Machine Vision Applications IV","25 January 2011 through 27 January 2011","San Francisco, CA","84411","0277786X","978-081948414-7","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79953160749"

Direct coupling between the analysis codes and the optimization routines can be prohibitively time consuming due to the complexity of the underlying simulation codes. One way of tackling this problem is by constructing computationally cheap(er) approximations of the expensive simulations that mimic the behavior of the simulation model as closely as possible. This paper presents a data driven, surrogate-based optimization algorithm that uses a trust region-based sequential approximate optimization (SAO) framework and a statistical sampling approach based on design of experiment (DOE) arrays. The algorithm is implemented using techniques from two packages-SURFPACK and SHEPPACK that provide a collection of approximation algorithms to build the surrogates and three different DOE techniques-full factorial (FF), Latin hypercube sampling, and central composite design-are used to train the surrogates. The results are compared with the optimization results obtained by directly coupling an optimizer with the simulation code. The biggest concern in using the SAO framework based on statistical sampling is the generation of the required database. As the number of design variables grows, the computational cost of generating the required database grows rapidly. A data driven approach is proposed to tackle this situation, where the trick is to run the expensive simulation if and only if a nearby data point does not exist in the cumulatively growing database. Over time the database matures and is enriched as more and more optimizations are performed. Results show that the proposed methodology dramatically reduces the total number of calls to the expensive simulation runs during the optimization process. © 2010 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Experiment management; Optimization; Problem solving environment; Response surface approximation; Sequential approximate optimization; Surrogate; Trust region strategy; Visualization; Wood-based composite materials","Approximation algorithms; Computer simulation; Database systems; Design; Design of experiments; Experiments; Optimization; Sampling; Visualization; Experiment management; Problem solving environment; Response surface approximation; Sequential approximate optimization; Surrogate; Trust region; Wood-based composites; Problem solving","","","","","","","14355663","","ENGCE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79960066459"

As such, we present a ""design space"" for such tools that consists of three elements: trust factors, collaborative traces, and visual representations. Trust factors are aspects of work shown in the research literature to influence one's perceived trustworthiness of their team members. Collaborative traces are representations of past and current work done by team members manipulating project artifacts. Collaborative traces provide information about a trust factor. Visual representations consist of a set of visual abstractions of the collaborative traces arranged in a layout that provides users with the ability to formulate accurate perceptions of their team members' trustworthiness with respect to a particular trust factor. Because the eventual goal of this research is to produce visual interfaces that support the development of trust, we apply elements from the design space to the design of three example visualizations. We conclude by assessing the value of the model and outlining future work. © 2012 ACM.","distributed teams; interactive and collaborative interfaces; trust; visual interface design","Design; Software design; Visualization; Collaborative interfaces; Design Principles; Design spaces; Distributed teams; Project artifacts; Team members; trust; Trust factor; Visual Interface; Visual representations; Distributed computer systems","","University of Salerno; Consulta Umbria SRL; ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI); ACM Special Interest Group on Multimedia (SIGMULTIMEDIA)","2012 International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces, AVI 2012","21 May 2012 through 25 May 2012","Capri Island","90946","","978-145031287-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84863571567"

We propose that a novel room agent leverages the emergent""smart"" city paradigm so as to form an accurate a measure as possible of the trustworthiness of the human agents using the office space. Namely, by leveraging pervasive urban sensors embedded in a smart city built environment, data obtained by crowd sourcing as well as data gathered via Web 2.0. Human actions detected within the room itself and its immediate environs, together with the behavioural traces and patterns of a given individual embedded within a smart city context, can be used to calculate a measurable confidence trust level. We suggest that the use of a Linking Open (or object) Data (LOD) publishing approach can be used to integrate trust related distributed data in a collective and intelligent manner. Furthermore, we suggest the use of cloud diagram and tree map visualisation approaches to depict individual and environs trust levels at both coarse and fine grain levels. To achieve this, we illustrate the approach using a low-level architecture model. We then conclude by outlining our theoretical lightweight trust model which aims to demonstrate how a smart city in general and a smart space in particular can provide an increased level of trust visualisation for it's citizens, through collective intelligence gathering. © 2012 IEEE.","Cloud diagram; Content-aware trust; Internet of Things; Linking open (object) data; Multi-agents; Network analysis; Smart spaces; Tree map","Buildings; Commerce; Computation; Internet; Maps; Trees; Electric network analysis; Electronic commerce; Forestry; Intelligent buildings; Internet; Office buildings; Security of data; Ubiquitous computing; Visualization; Content-aware; Internet of Things (IOT); Linking open (object) data; Multi agent; Smart space; Computer aided network analysis","","","6th International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing, IMIS 2012","4 July 2012 through 6 July 2012","Palermo","93290","","978-076954684-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84867725208"

AudioDAQ differs from existing phone peripheral interfaces by drawing all necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, encoding all data as analog audio, and leveraging the phone's built-in voice memo application (or a custom application) for continuous data collection. These properties make the AudioDAQ design more universal, so it works across a broad range of phones including sophisticated smart phones and simpler feature phones, enables simple analog peripherals without requiring a microcontroller, requires no hardware or software modifications on the phone itself, uses significantly less power than prior approaches, and allows continuous data capture over an extended period of time. The AudioDAQ design is efficient because it draws all necessary power from the microphone bias voltage, and it is general because this voltage and a voice memo application are present on most mobile phones in use today. We show the viability of our architecture by evaluating an end-to-end system that can capture EKG signals continuously for hours and send the data to the cloud for storage, processing, and visualization.

The users were shown multiple semi-transparent overlapping layers of flow and were asked how many different flow directions they were able to discern. We utilized textured lines as geometric primitives; two general texture models were used to control opacity and create animation.

With installations at leading manufacturers around the world, Objet has accumulated a great deal of experience in applying PolyJet technology in a wide range of industries, including footwear, toys, automotive, consumer goods, industrial manufacturing, and many more. Hundreds of companies, among them many of the world's largest in their fields, are using PolyJet-based RP systems in their design and manufacturing processes. By handling all RP in-house they can ensure confidentiality throughout design, reduce the cost of error, promote team creativity and reduce their time to market. Working with these customers, Objet realised that new applications for rapid prototyping could be opened up by enabling accurate models that closely resemble the end product not just in ""look"" but also in ""feel"". By combining proven technology with a wide range of materials, it becomes possible to bring the advantages of rapid prototyping to a broader range of industries and also vastly expand the applications within those industries. This is particularly true for the manufacturing of plastic goods. For example, in shoe manufacturing, the ability to genuinely feel the flexibility of the end product by bending the model of the sole would enable design adjustments early in the design cycle, avoiding time-consuming changes later in the process. PolyJet technology jets ultra-thin 16-micron layers of Objet's FullCure® photopolymer materials, delivering exceptional accuracy and allowing any geometry, including thin walls, overhangs and even moveable parts. Currently, Objet is investing significant resources in developing new materials and extending the applicability of PolyJet technology. The FullCure Tango series of model materials opens new applications by providing different levels of flexibility and elasticity. TangoBlack provides maximum elasticity and TangoGray is a slightly harder, yet flexible material that provides flexibility and elasticity that is more controlled. This enables models that closely resemble the ""feel"" of target products, such as medical, shoes, toys, and consumer electronics applications. Tango materials are also ideal for general industrial applications and rapid tooling. The FullCure Vero family of materials makes it possible to produce opaque models that closely resemble the ""look"" of the target products. The opaque surface enhances visualisation of details and edges, and good impact strength and flexural modulus, with a 20% elongation at break, enable a wide range of applications. Enhanced mechanical properties offer improved humidity resistance and the ability to withstand bending. Available as VeroWhite, VeroBlue and VeroBlack, the range of colours also helps to open up numerous applications in different industries. For example, VeroBlack enables consumer electronics manufacturers to simulate the look of black end-products without painting. The FullCure Transparent material is suitable for a wide range of rigid models, particularly where visibility of liquid flow or internal details is needed. Building on the innate flexibility of PolyJet technology, Objet is actively developing new systems and materials that will further broaden the range of applications for 3-D rapid prototyping. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group.","","Automobile electronic equipment; Concurrent engineering; Consumer electronics; Elasticity; Impact strength; Industrial applications; Industrial research; Industry; Job analysis; Mechanical properties; Pinch effect; Polymers; Rapid prototyping; Shoe manufacture; Technology; Three dimensional; Toy manufacture; 3-dimensional; Consumer electronics applications; Consumer Goods; Design cycles; Electronics manufacturers; Elongation at breaks; End products; Flexible materials; Flexural modulus; Humidity resistances; Industrial manufacturing; Liquid flows; Manufacturing process; Model materials; New applications; New materials; New systems; Opaque surfaces; Photopolymer materials; Rapid prototyping technologies; Rapid toolings; Rigid models; Team creativities; Thin walls; Time to markets; Transparent materials; Visualisation; Software prototyping","","","3rd International Conference on Advanced Research in Virtual and Rapid Prototyping: Virtual and Rapid Manufacturing Advanced Research Virtual and Rapid Prototyping","24 September 2007 through 29 September 2007","Leiria","75467","","978-041541602-3","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-75049083655"

Current network intrusion detection methods based on anomaly detection approaches suffer from fairly high error rate and low performance. The proposed flow based botnet detection system tackles these issues by combining data mining and visualization. The anomalous data is passed to several trust models, and the flows are re-evaluated to obtain their trustfulness, which is then aggregated to detect malicious traffic via visualization.

Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is one of the most important techniques developed to achieve direct perception of such volumetric data. It is based on semi-transparent representations, where the data are accumulated in a depth-dependent order. However, it produces images that may be difficult to understand, and thus several techniques have been proposed so as to improve its effectiveness, using for instance lighting models or simpler representations (e.g. Maximum Intensity Projection). In this paper we present two perceptual studies that question how DVR meets its goals, in either static or dynamic context. We show that a static representation is highly ambiguous, even in simple cases, but this can be counterbalanced by use of dynamic cues, i.e. motion parallax, provided that the rendering parameters are correctly tuned. © 2007 ACM.","Direct Volume Rendering; Perception of transparency; Static and dynamic cues","Data acquisition; Display devices; Motion estimation; Parameter estimation; Static analysis; Visualization; Direct Volume Rendering; Dynamic cues; Motion parallax; Rendering parameters; Volume rendering","","ACM SIG on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques","APGV 2007: 4th Symposium on Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization","25 May 2007 through 27 May 2007","Tubingen","70693","","159593670X; 978-159593670-7","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-36849074359"

The primary goal of the redesign was to switch from an inherently procedural programming language (Matlab) to an object-oriented language (Alice). This object-oriented approach to learning programming was also believed to be better for students bound for computer science and computer engineering. In addition, coverage of ethics, which had been constrained to engineering topics, will be broadened to include software issues.

The high domain knowledge barrier makes it difficult for a person who is outside this field to imagine the user experience, and the globally distributed core drilling community imposes more design constraints in space and time. In addition to activities proposed in prior literatures, we used the ""immersive empathic design"" approach of having a computer scientist trained as a junior core technician. Through in-situ observation and interview evaluations from on-going expeditions, we present the system and the lesson learned in the process. It makes the best use of precious co-located opportunities. It allows the developer to build up domain knowledge efficiently. It establishes a trust relationship between the developer and scientists. The system designed through this approach formed a sustainable foundation that was adapted in the following design iterations. This process allows the software developer to experience authentic user activities. The designed system is innovative and helps scientists solving real-world problems.

The role of middleware is to ease the task of designing, programming and managing distributed applications by providing a simple, consistent and integrated distributed programming environment. Essentially, middleware is a distributed software layer, which abstracts over the complexity and heterogeneity of the underlying distributed environment with its multitude of network technologies, machine architectures, operating systems and programming languages. Approach: This study brought out the development of supportive middleware to manage resources and distributed workload across multiple administrative boundaries is of central importance to Grid computing. Active middleware services that perform look-up, scheduling and staging are being developed that allow users to identify and utilize appropriate resources that provide sustainable system and user-level qualities of service. Results: Different middleware platforms support different programming models. Perhaps the most popular model is object-based middleware in which applications are structured into objects that interact via location transparent method invocation. Conclusion: The Object Management Group's CORBA platform offer an Interface Definition Language (IDL) which is used to abstract over the fact that objects can be implemented in any suitable programming language, an object request broker which is responsible for transparently directing method invocations to the appropriate target object and a set of services such as naming, time, transactions, replication which further enhance the programming environment. © 2010 Science Publications.","Collaborative visualization; Distributed; Integration; Middleware; Object based; Performance; Pervasive; Services; Transparent","","Science Publications","","","","","","15493636","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77952529921"

Multiple transparent isosurfaces can thus be used to visualize multiple material boundaries, but still fail to capture any data in between the boundary layers. We describe how isosurfaces can be ""enriched"" with surrounding material information. By visualizing surrounding material, both material boundary information and gradient - or change in density - information of the scalar field are represented. Visualizing multiple transparent material-enriched isosurfaces leads to a fairly effective volumetric impression. Thus, our approach approximates results obtained from direct volume rendering. The visualization of multiple transparent isosurfaces requires a back-to-front rendering of the typically triangulated surface components. The order of the surfaces' triangles is imposed by the location of the convex cells they are extracted from, which supports fast rendering of multiple isosurface.

A model of a phenomenon in cognitive psychology known as ""own-race bias"" (ORB) is employed using Principle Components Analysis (PCA) as the face recognition engine. The ORB FR system has demonstrated performance gain of 200% over the baseline technique of Eigenfaces on the MORPH Album 2 face database.

For proteins, the more abstract ribbon and cartoon representations are instead used to reveal large scale molecular conformation and connectivity. However, there is currently no accepted convention for simplifying oligo- and polysaccharide structures. We introduce two novel visualization algorithms for carbohydrates, incorporated into a visualization package, CarboHydra. Both algorithms highlight the sugar rings and backbone conformation of the carbohydrate chain, ignoring ring substituents. The first algorithm, termed PaperChain, emphasizes the type and conformation of the carbohydrate rings. The second, Twister, emphasizes the relative orientation of the rings. We further include two rendering enhancements to augment these visualizations: silhouettes edges and a translucent overlay of the ball-and-stick atomic representation. To demonstrate their utility, the algorithms and visualization enhancements are here applied to a variety of carbohydrate molecules. User evaluations indicate that they present a more useful view of carbohydrate structure than the standard ball-and-stick representation. The algorithms were found to be complementary, with PaperChain particularly effective for smaller carbohydrates and Twister useful at larger scales for highlighting the backbone twist of polysaccharides. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, although numerous alignment calculation and visualization tools have been developed to date, the analysis of complex genomic changes, such as large insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations and duplications, still presents certain difficulties. Results: We have developed a comparative genome analysis tool, named CGAT, which allows detailed comparisons of closely related bacteria-sized genomes mainly through visualizing middle-to-large-scale changes to infer underlying mechanisms. CGAT displays precomputed pairwise genome alignments on both dotplot and alignment viewers with scrolling and zooming functions, and allows users to move along the pre-identified orthologous alignments. Users can place several types of information on this alignment, such as the presence of tandem repeats or interspersed repetitive sequences and changes in G+C contents or codon usage bias, thereby facilitating the interpretation of the observed genomic changes. In addition to displaying precomputed alignments, the viewer can dynamically calculate the alignments between specified regions; this feature is especially useful for examining the alignment boundaries, as these boundaries are often obscure and can vary between programs. Besides the alignment browser functionalities, CGAT also contains an alignment data construction module, which contains various procedures that are commonly used for pre- and post-processing for large-scale alignment calculation, such as the split-and-merge protocol for calculating long alignments, chaining adjacent alignments, and ortholog identification. Indeed, CGAT provides a general framework for the calculation of genome-scale alignments using various existing programs as alignment engines, which allows users to compare the outputs of different alignment programs. Earlier versions of this program have been used successfully in our research to infer the evolutionary history of apparently complex genome changes between closely related eubacteria and archaea. Conclusion: CGAT is a practical tool for analyzing complex genomic changes between closely related genomes using existing alignment programs and other sequence analysis tools combined with extensive manual inspection. © 2006 Uchiyama et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Algorithms; Bacillus subtilis; Base Composition; Computer Graphics; Conserved Sequence; Databases, Nucleic Acid; DNA, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Evolution, Molecular; Helicobacter pylori; Polymorphism, Genetic; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Reproducibility of Results; Salmonella enterica; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software; Bacteria (microorganisms); Genes; Tools; cytosine; guanosine; bacterial DNA; Codon usage bias; Evolutionary history; Genome alignment; Genomic sequence; Manual inspection; Sequence analysis; Visualization tools; Zooming function; Archaebacterium; article; bacterial genome; calculation; codon usage; computer program; Eubacterium; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene insertion; gene sequence; gene translocation; genetic analysis; Helicobacter pylori; interspersed repeat; molecular evolution; nonhuman; sequence alignment; tandem repeat; algorithm; Bacillus subtilis; comparative study; computer graphics; DNA base composition; DNA sequence; Escherichia coli; genetic polymorphism; genetics; molecular evolution; nucleic acid database; nucleotide repeat; nucleotide sequence; procedures; reproducibility; Salmonella enterica; Alignment","","","","","","","14712105","","BBMIC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-33751190274"

The system is designed to be platform independent, as all virtual reality functions are separated from kernel functions. Due to its modular design, our system can be easily extended to other virtual environments, and new functions can be incorporated rapidly. © 2008 IEEE.","","Bioinformatics; Functions; Information analysis; Information science; Information systems; Probability density function; Sensory perception; User interfaces; Virtual reality; Visualization; Volume rendering; Volumetric analysis; 3d textures; Autostereoscopic displays; Data sets; Direct volume renderings; Geometric representations; Immersive environments; Immersive visualizations; Kernel functions; Modular designs; Platform independents; Rendering processes; Time visualizations; Transparency functions; Virtual environments; Volumetric datums; Data visualization","","","5th International Conference BioMedical Visualization: Information Visualization in Medical and Biomedical Informatics, MediVis 2008","9 July 2008 through 11 July 2008","London","74798","","978-076953284-4","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57849137509"

Methods and materials: The data were collected in the GammaKnife radiosurgery setting and analyzed using qualitative methods. Observations and in-depth interviews with neurosurgeons and physicists were performed at three clinics using the Leksell GammaKnife®. Result: The users' ability to perform cognitive tasks was found to be reduced each time visualizations incongruent with the particular user's perception of clinical reality were used. The main issue here was a lack of transparency, i.e. a black box problem where machine representations ""stood between"" users and the cognitive tasks they wanted to perform. For neurosurgeons, transparency meant their previous experience from traditional surgery could be applied, i.e. that they were not forced to perform additional cognitive work. From the view of the physicists, on the other hand, the concept of transparency was associated with mathematical precision and avoiding creating a cognitive distance between basic patient data and what is experienced as clinical reality. The physicists approached clinical visualization technology as though it was a laboratory apparatus-one that required continual adjustment and assessment in order to ""capture"" a quantitative clinical reality. Conclusion: Designers of visualization technology need to compare the cognitive interpretations generated by the new visualization systems to conceptions generated during ""traditional"" clinical work. This means that the viewpoint of different clinical user groups involved in a given clinical task would have to be taken into account as well. A way forward would be to acknowledge that visualization is a socio-cognitive function that has practice-based antecedents and consequences, and to reconsider what analytical and scientific challenges this presents us with. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical visualization; Cognitive science; Human-computer interaction; Neurosurgery; Situated cognition","Cognition; Humans; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive systems; Computers; Hospital data processing; Human computer interaction; Knowledge management; Neurosurgery; Transparency; Black boxes; Clinical realities; Clinical tasks; Clinical use; Clinical visualization; Clinical works; Cognitive functions; Cognitive science; Cognitive tasks; Cognitive works; In-depth interviews; Laboratory apparatus; Machine representations; Mathematical precision; Patient datum; Qualitative methods; Radiosurgery; Situated cognition; Time visualizations; User groups; Visualization systems; Visualization technologies; accuracy; article; artificial intelligence; clinical practice; controlled study; data analysis; gamma knife radiosurgery; human; imaging system; interview; mental task; observational study; priority journal; qualitative analysis; scientist; surgeon; task performance; treatment planning; vision; Visualization","","","","","","","09333657","","AIMEE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67349247387"

Among those issues, when the problematic events occurred and need attentions of responsible persons, the notice methods are often applying multiple communication media such as vocal communication, SMS messages and pictures taken from the field in addition to emails, web pages and written documentation. Without fully integration among those media, the restriction as well as the advantage for each media shows. With more advanced information technology appears now, the possibility of representation as well as the seamless integration becomes diverse and emergent in our daily life. Among those, a trend of human computer interfaces called ambient interfaces shows a promising direction for coordinating those media in a settle manor. Therefore, following three groups of researches-information technology in construction application, process information visualization and ambient interfaces, in this research we propose a prototype system called Interactive Circle Biosphere (ICBO) for testing the concepts for the problem we address.

For this work, we collaborated with a neurosurgeon who is comparing multiple tumor segmentations with the goal of increasing the segmentation accuracy and reliability. A second collaborator, a physicist, aims to validate geometric models of specimens against atomic-force microscope images of actual specimens. These collaborators are interested in comparing both surface shape and inter-surface distances. Many commonly employed techniques for visually comparing multiple surfaces (side-by-side, wireframe, colormaps, uniform translucence) do not simultaneously convey inter-surface distance and the shapes of two or more surfaces. This paper describes a simple geometric partitioning of intersecting surfaces that enables the application of existing nested-surface techniques, such as texture-modulated translucent rendering of exteriors, to a broader range of visualization problems. Three user studies investigate the performance of existing techniques and a new shadow-casting glyph technique. The results of the first user study show that texture glyphs on partitioned, intersecting surfaces can convey inter-surface distance better than directly mapping distance to a red-gray-blue color scale on a single surface. The results of the second study show similar results for conveying local surface orientation. The results of the third user study show that adding cast shadows to texture glyphs can increase the understanding of inter-surface distance in static images, but can be overpowered by the shape cues from a simple rocking motion. © 2005 IEEE.","Intersecting surfaces; Nested surfaces; Perception; Scientific visualization; Transparent surfaces; Two-surface visualization; User study","Atomic force microscopy; Computational geometry; Conformal mapping; Image segmentation; Problem solving; Sensory perception; Surface structure; Tumors; Intersecting surfaces; Nested surfaces; Scientific visualization; Transparent surfaces; Two-surface visualization; Visualization","","","VIS 05: IEEE Visualization 2005, Proceedings","23 October 2005 through 28 October 2005","Minneapolis, MN","68219","","0780394623; 978-078039462-9","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33749425526"

In order to calculate the illumination at each point in a scene, the photon density needs to be estimated. Standard estimation methods will have problems with typical architectural scenes, as walls and corners will lead to undesirable light and shadow leaks. We introduce a new method for estimating photon density in photon maps, that is especially suited for calculating global illumination in architectural scenes. By providing additional information using a limited number of ray-casts, shadow and light leaks can be significantly reduced, thereby resulting in a significant improvement in the speed and accuracy of global illumination algorithms based on photon maps.

Example effects include transparency, translucency, constructive solid geometry, depth-of-field, direct volume rendering, and isosurface visualization. With current GPUs, programmers implement these effects using multiple passes over the scene geometry, often substantially limiting performance. This paper introduces a generalization of the Z-buffer, called the k-buffer, that makes it possible to efficiently implement such algorithms with only a single geometry pass, yet requires only a small, fixed amount of additional memory. The k-buffer uses framebuffer memory as a read-modify-write (RMW) pool of k entries whose use is programmatically defined by a small k-buffer program. We present two proposals for adding k-buffer support to future GPUs and demonstrate numerous multiple-fragment, single-pass graphics algorithms running on both a software-simulated k-buffer and a k-buffer implemented with current GPUs. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the large number of graphics algorithms that the k-buffer enables and that the efficiency is superior to current multipass approaches.

It was confirmed that the proposed microfluidic system controls the concentration of fluorescent dye for a long term observation in water and is useful to apply CNTs to several biological application fields. ©2007 IEEE.","","Concentration (process); Conductive films; Fluorescence; Light emission; Luminescence; Microchannels; Nanocomposites; Nanofluidics; Nanopores; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Photoresists; Silicones; Social sciences; Background conditions; Biological applications; Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Chip system; Constant excitation; Dielectrophoretic forces; Fluorescence dyes; Fluorescent dyes; Fluorescent microscopy; Fluorescent reagents; Homogeneous concentration; Human sciences; International symposium; Long term; Magnetic stirrers; Micro fluidic systems; Nanomechatronics; Poly-di-methyl siloxane; Porous structures; Reversal contrast; Transparent conductive film; Visualization methods; Carbon nanotubes","","IEEE Robotics and Automation Society; City of Nagoya; Nagoya University; Kagawa University; NPO Humanwear Network Initiative","2007 International Symposium on Micro-NanoMechatronics and Human Science, MHS","11 November 2007 through 14 November 2007","Nagoya","73244","","978-142441858-9","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-50149087517"

These are ISIS, SNS and J-PARC from UK, US and Japan respectively. As instruments are being designed for High Flux Isotope Reactors, Spallation Neutron Sources, and other neutron sources, there is an unprecedented opportunity to provide superior data analysis software capabilities for scientific users. Before these analysis capabilities can be provided, users need a way of managing and gaining access to the large amounts of data these sources can generate. The Data Portal project aims to provide the distributed searching capabilities by giving easy, transparent access to experimental, simulation and visualisation data kept on their multitude of systems and sites. Further more it will provide links to other grid services, which will allow the cientists to further use the selected data, e.g. to un their data analysis software. The Data Portal ill aim to work as a broker between the cientists, the instruments, the data and other ervices. The problem addressed is that currently the scientific data is stored distributed across a multitude of sites and systems. Scientific users have only very limited support in accessing, managing and transferring their data or indeed in identifying new data resources. In a true Grid environment, it is essential to ease many of these processes and the aim of the Data Portal is to help with automating many of these tasks.","Data management; Globus; Metadata; Storage resource broker (SRB); Web services","Computer software; Electrostatic actuators; Information management; Metadata; Neutron sources; Neutrons; Spalling; Strain relaxation; Superconducting materials; Web services; Analysis capabilities; Data analysis softwares; Data management; Data portals; Data resources; Gaining access; Globus; Grid environments; Grid services; High flux isotope reactors; Large amounts of datum; Neutron science; Scientific datum; Searching capabilities; Spallation neutron sources; Storage resource broker (SRB); Transparent access; Visualisation; Grid computing","","","2005 International Conference on Grid Computing and Applications, GCA'05","20 June 2005 through 23 June 2005","Las Vegas, NV","75420","","978-193241557-5","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-60749135633"

These techniques were additionally evaluated in a confirmatory study in which participants were asked to judge whether a filament runs through a transparent structure.

Direct volume rendering (DVR) is one of the most important techniques developed to achieve direct perception of such volumetric data. It is based on semitransparent representations, where the data are accumulated in a depth-dependent order. However, it produces images that may be difficult to understand, and thus several techniques have been proposed so as to improve its effectiveness, using for instance lighting models or simpler representations (e.g., maximum intensity projection). In this article, we present three perceptual studies that examine how DVR meets its goals, in either static or dynamic context. We show that a static representation is highly ambiguous, even in simple cases, but this can be counterbalanced by use of dynamic cues (i.e., motion parallax) provided that the rendering parameters are correctly tuned. In addition, perspective projections are demonstrated to provide relevant information to disambiguate depth perception in dynamic displays. © 2009 ACM.","Direct volume rendering; Perception of transparency; Perspective projection; Structure from motion","Data visualization; Depth perception; Geometrical optics; Medical imaging; Transparency; Videodisks; Voltage regulators; Volumetric analysis; Direct volume rendering; Dynamic contexts; Dynamic cues; Dynamic displays; Lighting models; Maximum intensity projections; Motion parallaxes; Perception of transparency; Perspective projection; Space fillings; Static representations; Structure from motion; Volumetric datum; Volume rendering","","","","","","","15443965","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-60349120833"

The integrated analysis of gene expression data and 3′-UTR sequences holds great promise for being an effective means to systematically delineate active miRs in different biological processes. Applying such an integrated analysis, we uncovered a striking relationship between 3′-UTR AU content and gene response in numerous microarray datasets. We show that this relationship is secondary to a general bias that links gene response and probe AU content and reflects the fact that in the majority of current arrays probes are selected from target transcript 3′-UTRs. Therefore, removal of this bias, which is in order in any analysis of microarray datasets, is of crucial importance when integrating expression data and 3′-UTR sequences to identify regulatory elements embedded in this region. We developed visualization and normalization schemes for the detection and removal of such AU biases and demonstrate that their application to microarray data significantly enhances the computational identification of active miRs. Our results substantiate that, after removal of AU biases, mRNA expression profiles contain ample information which allows in silico detection of miRs that are active in physiological conditions. © 2008 Elkon, Agami.","","3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Base Composition; Bias (Epidemiology); Computational Biology; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Gene Expression Profiling; Hematopoiesis; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Multipotent Stem Cells; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; RNA, Messenger; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Data visualization; Gene expression; RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; messenger RNA; Biological networks; Biological process; Computational biology; Computational identification; Expression data; Gene Expression Data; Gene response; Integrated analysis; Microarray dataset; mRNA expression; 3' untranslated region; article; controlled study; DNA microarray; gene expression; human; protein folding; RNA analysis; RNA sequence; 3' untranslated region; animal; biology; cytology; DNA base composition; DNA microarray; epidemiology; gene expression profiling; genetics; hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem cell; metabolism; mouse; multipotent stem cell; nucleic acid database; statistics; T lymphocyte subpopulation; Probes","Public Library of Science","","","","","","1553734X","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-55449117619"

Deploying ArtLinks revealed that people have strong expectations of technology as an information appliance.

Moreover, trust is a central component in this type of activity to surmount the uncertainty.

Conducting an evaluation while drawing partial user attention is a challenging problem. Many normal information visualization evaluation methods (full attention) may not suit the evaluation of ambient displays. Inspired by concepts in the social and behavioral science, we categorize the evaluation of ambient displays into two methodologies: intrusive and non-intrusive. The major difference between these two approaches is the level of user involvement, as an intrusive evaluation requires a higher user involvement than a non-intrusive evaluation. Based on our long-term (5 months) non-intrusive evaluation of Fisherman presented in [16], this paper provides a detailed discussion of the actual technical and experimental setup of unobtrusively measurement of user gaze over a long period by using a face-tracking camera and IR sensors. In addition, this paper also demonstrates a solution to the ethical problem of using video cameras to collect data in a semi-public place.

Kunimoto et al. (2001) proposed a measure of awareness (a′) which apparently meets this criterion: a′ is derived from confidence ratings and is based on the intuition that confidence should reflect awareness. The aim of this paper is to explore the validity of this measure. Some calculations suggested that, contrary to Kunimoto et al. 's intention, a′ can vary as a result of changes in response bias affecting the relative proportions of high- and low-confidence responses. This was not evident in the results of Kunimoto et al. 's original experiments because their method may have artificially 'clamped' observers' response bias close to zero. A predicted consequence of allowing response bias to vary freely is that it can result in a′ varying from negative, through zero, to positive values, for a given value of discriminability (d1). We tested whether such variations are likely to occur in practice by employing Kunimoto et al. 's paradigm with various modifications, notably the removal of constraints upon the proportions of low- and high-confidence responses, in a visual discrimination task. As predicted, a' varied with response bias in all participants. Similar results were found when a′ was calculated from pre-existing data obtained from a patient with blindsight: a′ varied through a range of positive results without approaching zero, which is inconsistent with his well-documented lack of awareness.

Although delving into well-known computational fluid dynamics may provide a solution to create such an appearance, we propose a much efficient alternative that combines a low-resolution fluid simulation with explicit geometry provided by NURBS surfaces. Among a wide spectrum of fluid simulation, our algorithm specifically tailors to reproduce the semi-transparent surface look and motion of the smoke. The main idea is that we follow the traces called streaklines created by the advected particles from a simulation and reconstruct NURBS surfaces passing through them. Then, we render the surfaces by applying an opacity map to each surface, where the opacity map is created by utilizing the smoke density and the characteristics of the surface contour. Augmenting the results from low-resolution simulations such a way requires a low computational cost and memory usage by design. © 2010 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Fluid animation; Smoke; Streakline; Surface; Visualization","Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Flow visualization; Opacity; Surfaces; Visualization; Cigarette smokes; Computational costs; Fluid animation; Fluid simulations; Semi-transparent; Smoke visualization; Streakline; Surface contour; Smoke","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","","","","","","01677055","","CGFOD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78649299008"

In order to judge the validity of information, it is important to know how trustworthy its creator is. Since no individual can have direct knowledge of more than a small fraction of information authors, methods for inferring trust are needed. We propose a new trust inference scheme based on the idea that a trust network can be viewed as a random graph, and a chain of trust as a path in that graph. In addition to having an intuitive interpretation, our algorithm has several advantages, noteworthy among which is the creation of an inferred trust-metric space where the shorter the distance between two people, the higher their trust.

For a realistic visualization of the models, transparency and shadows are essential features. We propose a method for point cloud rendering with transparency and shadows at interactive rates. Our approach does not require any global or local surface reconstruction method, but operates directly on the point cloud. All passes are executed in image space and no pre-computation steps are required. The underlying technique for our approach is a depth peeling method for point cloud surface representations. Having detected a sorted sequence of surface layers, they can be blended front to back with given opacity values to obtain renderings with transparency. These computation steps achieve interactive frame rates. For renderings with shadows, we determine a point cloud shadow texture that stores for each point of a point cloud whether it is lit by a given light source. The extraction of the layer of lit points is obtained using the depth peeling technique, again. For the shadow texture computation, we also apply a Monte-Carlo integration method to approximate light from an area light source, leading to soft shadows. Shadow computations for point light sources are executed at interactive frame rates. Shadow computations for area light sources are performed at interactive or near-interactive frame rates depending on the approximation quality.","Point-based rendering; Shadows; Transparency","Computer graphics; Computer vision; Light sources; Textures; Visualization; Approximation quality; Computation steps; Frame rate; Image space; Interactive frame rates; Interactive rates; Monte Carlo integration; Point cloud; Point cloud surface; Point light source; Point-based rendering; Pre-computation; Shadow textures; Shadows; Soft shadow; Surface layers; Transparency","","","18th International Conference in Central Europe on Computer Graphics, Visualization and Computer Vision, WSCG 2010","1 February 2010 through 4 February 2010","Plzen","89891","","978-808694388-6","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84862099320"

Often computationally mediated, these collaborations challenge researchers' trust practices. Focusing on the visualisations that are often at the heart of this form of scientific practice, the paper proposes that the aesthetic aspects of these visualisations are themselves a way of securing trust. Kant's account of aesthetic judgements in the Third Critique is drawn upon in order to show that the image-building capability of imagination, and the sensus communis, both of which are integral parts of aesthetic experience, play an important role in building and sustaining community in these forms of science. Kant's theory shows that the aesthetic appeal of scientific visualisations is not isolated from two other dimensions of the visualisations: the cognitive-epistemic, aesthetic-stylistic and interpersonal dimensions, and that in virtue of these inter-relationships, visualisations contribute to building up the intersubjectively shared framework of agreement which is basic for trust. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Aesthetic; Epistemic; Image; Kant; Science; Trust; Visualisation","Information technology; Aesthetic; Epistemic; Image; Kant; Science; Trust; Visualization","","","","","","","15728439","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57049121777"

However, a variety of abstract datasets can indeed be related to, and hence enriched by, real-world aspects. In these cases an additional virtual representation of the 3D object can help to gain a better insight into the connection between abstract and real-world issues. We demonstrate this approach with two prototype systems that combine information visualisation with 3D models in multiple coordinated views. The first prototype involves the visualisation of in-car communication traces. The 3D model of the car serves as one view among several and provides the user with information about the car's activities. LibViz, our second prototype, is based on a full screen 3D representation of a library building. Measured data is visualised in overlaid, semi-transparent windows to allow the user interpretation of the data in its spatial context of the library's 3D model.

It is therefore very important to develop an effective trust management system that assists e-commerce participants to make good trust decisions. This paper describes a visualization approach towards such a system. The benefits of this approach are three-fold: First, it gives a better understanding of the components that can be used in a trust management system. Secondly, it illustrates that the components contributing to the trust making process can be different from one environment to another. Thirdly, it shows that the way one person trusts can be different from others. This approach, rather than using the same static attributes to calculate trust for everyone, uses specific attributes based on each truster's goals.

The visibility, in terms of back-to-front polygon visibility ordering, can be determined by updating a priority list as the viewpoint moves. A new list-priority algorithm, utilizing a property of Voronoi diagrams, is proposed in this paper. In the preprocessing phase, the 3D space is divided into Voronoi cells in order to cluster polygons that can be assigned a fixed set of priority orders within the cluster. and during the post-processing phase, the clusters and contained polygons are depth-sorted correctly. The most time-consuming work is undertaken during the pre-processing phase that only has to be executed once for the scene. All the polygons in a cluster are pre-computed to obtain the view independent priority order within the cluster. Thus, a relatively simple task is left in the post-processing phase, which is only to sort the clusters repeatedly when the viewpoint is changed. One reason to explore list-priority algorithm is because they offer flexibility that hardware configuration (such as Z-buffer approach) do not possess. One example is that of rendering with the correct treatment of the translucency effects. Translucency is an important graphics effect that can be used to increase the realism of the rendered scene or to enable more effective visual inspection in visualization.","Depth sorting; Transparency rendering; Visibility determination; Voronoi diagram","Clustering algorithms; Computer graphics; Computer hardware; Depth indicators; Program processors; Visualization; Polygon visibility; Translucency; Transparency rendering; Voronoi diagram; Visibility","","ACM SIG on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques, SIGGRAPH","GRAPHITE 2006: 4th International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Australasia and Southeast Asia","29 November 2006 through 2 December 2006","Kuala Lumpur","69923","","1595935649; 978-159593564-9","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34547208227"

The benefits of feature selection include improved data visualisation, transparency, reduction in training and utilisation times and improved prediction performance. Methods based on fuzzy-rough set theory (FRFS) have employed the dependency function to guide the process with much success. This paper presents a novel fuzzy-rough FS technique which is guided by fuzzy entropy. The use of this measure in fuzzy-rough feature selection can result in smaller subset sizes than those obtained through FRFS alone, with little loss or even an increase in overall classification accuracy. © 2006 IEEE.","","Data visualization; Fuzzy sets; Rough set theory; Transparency; Dependency function; Feature Selection (FS); Fuzzy entropy; Fuzzy-rough feature selection; Feature extraction","","","2006 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems","16 July 2006 through 21 July 2006","Vancouver, BC","69808","10987584","0780394887; 978-078039488-9","PIFSF","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-34250760780"

A target procedure is breast cancer examination with a tactile sensor. The special tactile sensor is used to measure tissue stiffness values at discrete points of the examined organ. We developed an augmented reality system which integrates the tactile sensor, a head-mounted display with a small video camera, and a notebook computer. Tracking of the human organ and the tactile sensor is based on optical markers. One marker is attached to the patient's body and is used to track the spatial position of the human organ. Another marker is placed on the tactile sensor. Registering space positions of this marker with respect to the first marker allows determination of the shape of the human organ for subsequent data visualization. Results of stiffness measurements are depicted as semi-transparent three-dimensional objects projected on the patient's body. Different visualization techniques are employed depending on the amount of data and user preference. Experiments with sensing tactile data and its visualization for a variety of objects, including a silicon breast model and animals organs, have been perfonned. It was found that the developed augmented-reality system is useful in medical-physics measurements.","Augmented reality; Tactile measurements; Visualization","Animals; Data visualization; Laptop computers; Optical sensors; Stiffness; Video cameras; Virtual reality; Visualization; Augmented reality systems; Breast Cancer; Discrete points; Head mounted displays; Health examinations; Note-book computer; Optical markers; Real time visualization; Reality systems; Semi-transparent; Spatial positions; Stiffness measurements; Tactile measurements; Tactile sensors; Three-dimensional object; Tissue stiffness; Visualization technique; Augmented reality","","","2nd International Conference on Computer Graphics Theory and Applications, GRAPP 2007","8 March 2007 through 11 March 2007","Barcelona","76457","","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649951531"

We introduce a group communication theory, the Collective Information Sharing (CIS) bias, and discuss how it relates to communicative goals that need to be considered when designing collaborative, visually enabled, spatial-decision-support tools. The CIS bias framework suggests that key goals for developing such tools should be: (a) the harnessing of a group's collective knowledge emerging from collaborative discussions and (b) reducing the repeat of information that has already been shared within the group. We propose that web-accessible, map annotation tools are ideally suited to advancing these goals and outline how the CIS bias framework informs how geospatial annotation tools can maximize the potential of collaborative efforts. We offer design recommendations for annotation tools that function to: (a) facilitate access to and recall of geographically referenced discussion contributions, (b) document ideas for private as well as public discussion spaces, and (c) elicit all group members to contribute information in a given collaborative effort.","Collaboration; Collective Information Sharing (GIS) bias theory; Geospatial annotations","analytical method; GIS; map; spatial analysis; visualization","","","","","","","13623087","","IGISF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-34347261019"

We extend prior work to study the effect of shared information on collaboration. We analyzed the success and discussion process of remote pairs trying to identify a serial killer in multiple crime cases. Each partner had half of the evidence, or each partner had all the available evidence. Pairs also used one of three tools: spreadsheet only (control condition), unshared visualizations, or shared visualization. Visualizations improved analysis over the control condition but this improvement depended on how much evidence each partner had. When each partner possessed all the evidence with visualizations, discussion flagged and pairs showed evidence of more confirmation bias. They discussed fewer hypotheses and persisted on the wrong hypothesis. We discuss the possible reasons for this phenomenon and implications for design of remote collaboration systems to incorporate awareness of intermediate processes important to collaborative success.

However, recently, it has been shown that only non-straightforward extensions exist for classification problems. In this paper, we present an alternative visualization framework for classification problems called zone analysis. Our zone analysis framework partly extends the bias-variance idea; instead of decomposing an error into two parts, i.e. the biased and unbiased components, our framework decomposes the error into K components. While bias-variance information is still contained in our framework, our framework provides interesting observations which are not obviously seen in the previous bias-variance framework, e.g. a prejudice behavior of the bagging algorithm to various unbiased instances. Our framework is suitable for visualizing an effect of context changes on learning performance. The type of context changes which we primarily investigate in the paper is ""a change from a base learner to an ensemble learner such as bagging, adaboost, arc-x4 and multi-boosting"". © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Bagging; Bias-variance analysis; Boosting; Ensemble methods; Zone analysis","Visualization; AdaBoost; Base learners; Boosting ensembles; Learning performance; Regression problem; Variance analysis; Variance information; Visualization framework; Adaptive boosting","","","","","","","02692821","","AIRVE","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-75149130838"

Despite of its wide use, the data set has certain weaknesses: i) the objects are practically in a standard pose and scale in the middle of the images and ii) background varies too little in certain categories making it more discriminative than the foreground objects. In this work, we demonstrate how these weaknesses bias the evaluation results in an undesired manner. In addition, we reduce the bias effect by replacing the backgrounds with random landscape images from Google and by applying random Euclidean transformations to the foreground objects. We demonstrate how the proposed randomization process makes visual object categorization more challenging improving the relative results of methods which categorize objects by their visual appearance and are invariant to pose changes.

One type of problem is regional bias, in which one region of a chip shows artifactually high or low intensities (or ratios in a two-channel array) relative to the majority of the chip. Current practice in quality assessment for microarrays does not address regional biases. Results: We present methods implemented in R for visualizing regional biases and other spatial artifacts on spotted microarrays and Affymetrix chips. We also propose a statistical index to quantify regional bias and investigate its typical distribution on spotted and Affymetrix arrays. We demonstrate that notable regional biases occur on both Affymetrix and spotted arrays and that they can make a significant difference in the case of spotted microarray results. Although strong biases are also seen at the level of individual probes on Affymetrix chips, the gene expression measures are less affected, especially when the RMA method is used to summarize intensities for the probe sets. A web application program for visualization and quantitation of regional bias is provided at http://www.discover.nci.nih.gov/affytools. Conclusion: Researchers should visualize and measure the regional biases and should estimate their impact on gene expression measurements obtained. Here, we (i) introduce pictorial visualizations of the spatial biases; (ii) present for Affymetrix chips a useful resolution of the biases into two components, one related to background, the other to intensity scale factor; (iii) introduce a single parameter to reflect the global bias present across an array. We also examine the pattern distribution of such biases and conclude that algorithms based on smoothing are unlikely to compensate adequately for them. © 2005 Reimers and Weinstein; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Artifacts; Bias (Epidemiology); Calibration; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Quality Control; Gene expression; Probes; Quality control; Visualization; genomic DNA; Affymetrix Chip; Current practices; Expression measurements; Gene expression microarray; Intensity scale; Quality assessment; Single parameter; Statistical indices; article; artifact; computer program; controlled study; DNA microarray; DNA probe; gene expression; genetic algorithm; genetic parameters; Internet; quality control; quantitative analysis; statistical analysis; calibration; computer assisted diagnosis; devices; DNA microarray; procedures; standards; statistical bias; Microarrays","","","","","","","14712105","","BBMIC","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-25444444696"

This paper also presents a method that constructs fuzzy models in the visualized space for knowledge extraction. The proposed method is to obtain transparent models for understanding input-output relationships of unknown systems, and thus to show guidelines for constructing models with more appropriate structures.

The proposed method constructs a transparent model on the fusion axes using Fuzzy C-Means and Fuzzy Multiple Discriminant Analysis. This paper shows thorough a numerical experiment that the proposed method can identify an appropriate fusion axis to visualize the input-output relationships.

Large volumes of identical parts, fully automated production lines combined with the extreme demands on speed, precision and quality makes fast response to changing demands important for the overall competitiveness. The manufacturing unit has been built and implemented based on Lean Manufacturing and Extended Enterprise Principles. The concept of extended enterprise is directly applicable, and provides a platform for understanding, discussion and decision. The need to establish basic principles prior to the development of solutions is important. The need for a common visual description of the value chain is vital. Showing the value chain, its partners and material flow, the information flow, the processes etc. The Extended Enterprise model, along with other tools and methods, have proven useful, but far from complete. The case also shows that there is still lack of flexibility in ERP systems. RCT has a very simple BOM (2 levels) and the ERP system should not force a complicated and resource-demanding planning process onto the company! As a consequence the strive for Lean ICT solutions must continue, where the systems and the use of them can be upsized or downsized in fluctuation with the product range, product complexity, demand fluctuations and emerging markets. The need to achieve transparency without creating nervousness is an important challenge when allowing huge amount of information to be available throughout the value chain. Indicators of performance and status of the value chain flows are important. The RCT case is an example of how theory, models and concept can directly be applied to support industrial development. And the case feeds back updated needs for further research and development on Extended Enterprise and Supply Chain Management. © 2003 by Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Automotive value chain; Extended enterprise; Forrester effect; Lean production; Logistic model; Supply chain management; Transparency; Visualisation","Automobile manufacture; Industry; Information technology; Supply chain management; Transparency; Visualization; Automotive value; Extended enterprise; Forrester effect; Lean production; Logistic models; Enterprise resource planning","Springer New York LLC","","IFIP TC5 / WG5.7 8th International Conference on Advances in Production Management Systems","8 September 2002 through 13 September 2002","Eindhoven","106341","18684238","978-147574791-1","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84904291781"

Based on analysis of basic characteristics of modules, the concept of module intensity and its computation rules were introduced. And a DSM was utilized to model the interactions among all components of a given product. Then, a serial of values of module intensity for all potential modules were generated by imposing modules intensity on the new DSM optimized by genetic algorithm. As a result, the process of module identification could be visualized by coloring in the optimized-DSM with different transparency according to the values of module intensity, and a basis was generated to provide more choices and understanding for module identification under different design requirements. Finally, effectiveness and applicability of this approach were validated by its application in identifying the modules of CNC coiling machine.","Design structure matrix; Modularized design; Product design; Visualization","Genetic algorithms; Transparency; Visualization; CNC coiling machine; Design structure matrix; Modularized design; Modules identification; Product design","","","","","","","10065911","","JJZXF","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-38649142846"

Because of its simple set-up and insensitivity to rigid body translations, the method has gained considerable importance in nondestructive testing in an industrial environment. Despite of its advantages, however, its application remains limited to highly scattering opaque samples due to its high dependence on the quality of speckles. This study demonstrates the suitability of digital shearography in the strain analysis of acrylic glass, a transparent sample, under sub-surface compaction loading. To generate the speckles, nominal roughness is induced at the front surface of the glass. As compared to the polariscope, digital shearography is shown to be able to resolve microscopic displacements that may not be evident as birefringence. Microscopic strain induced in the sample in the order of 60 microstrains is resolved using the shearographic set-up. For a more complete investigation of the deformation in the sample, the sub-surface displacements in the material are also mapped using Fourier digital holography to complement the shearographic results. The technique can be applied to fluid flow visualization and evaluation of polymers and other transparent materials.","Coherent metrology; Fourier optics; Holographic interferometry; Nondestructive testing; Shearography; Strain measurement","Computer generated holography; Deformation; Dendrites (metallography); Elastic constants; Flow visualization; Fluid dynamics; Fourier transforms; Glass; Interferometers; Measurements; Nondestructive examination; Real time systems; Speckle; Strain gages; Strain measurement; Surface defects; Surfaces; Acrylic glass; Coherent metrology; Deformation analysis; Digital holographies; Digital shearography; Direct measurements; Fluid flow visualizations; Fourier; Front surfaces; Industrial environments; Microscopic displacements; Microstrains; Nondestructive testing; Optical techniques; Rigid bodies; Shearography; Strain analysis; Sub surfaces; Sub-surface defects; Transparent materials; Holographic interferometry","","","9th International Symposium on Laser Metrology","30 June 2008 through 2 July 2008","","74498","0277786X","978-081947398-1","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-57549096161"

Focusing on the specific example of the fields of educational psychology and instructional technology and design, this paper begins by describing how the workings of the ""tools to theory heuristic"" are evident in the metaphors and descriptions of behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. In each of these psychological paradigms, the mind is understood in terms of a contemporaneous technological innovation: as rudimentary circuitry, as computerized data processing, and finally, in terms of information representation and visualization. The paper then argues that in applied disciplines like educational technology and human-computer interaction, technology plays two important but conflicting roles. It first operates heuristically to explain complex mental phenomena; it is then designed and developed explicitly as a tool for facilitating and developing these same complex mental processes. This paper concludes by arguing that this dual role represents an ethical dilemma-a kind of epistemological and practical ""conflict of interest"" in instructional technology and in related fields of systems and interface design. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2009.","Ethics; Human-computer interaction; Instructional technology; Psychology; Tools to theory heuristic","Data processing; Philosophical aspects; Tools; Conflict of interest; Educational psychology; Ethics; Information representation and visualization; Instructional technology; Interface designs; Psychology; Technological innovation; Human computer interaction","","","","","","","14355655","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77950299981"

In this paper, we develop performance metrics to measure and compare the scalability of the resources of virtualization on the cloud data centres. First, we discuss the need for a reliable method to compare the performance of cloud services among a number of various services being offered. Second, we develop a different type of metrics and propose a suitable methodology to measure the scalability using these types of metrics. We focus on the visualization resources such as CPU, storage disk, and network infrastructure. Finally, we compare well-known cloud providers using the proposed approach and conclude the recommendations.

In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces.

The ultra-light and highly transparent aerogels may provide the best optical medium for these displays as they can be easily fabricated in the form of a large-volume, low-scattering bulk material. On the other hand, the semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots, QDs) are a remarkable fluorescent material with optical properties superior to those of conventional materials. QDs dispersed in aerogels hold a promise to become the most efficient display material for volumetric 3D displays. The true volumetric displays described in the literature are built around the concept of two beams exciting the fluorescent material in their intersection. However, the optical properties of QDs are quite different from these of the fluorescent materials proposed for intersecting-beams displays and it may not be feasible to build such displays using QDs. Instead, we are proposing the use of a single focused infrared laser beam to excite a nanostructured material for volumetric color displays consisting of QDs dispersed in a transparent silica aerogel matrix. Presented are the theory and modeling results proving the feasibility of this approach. © 2010 SPIE.","Quantum dots; Silica aerogels; Static volumetric displays","Aerogels; Avionics; Display devices; Fluorescence; Imaging systems; Infrared lasers; Materials; Optical properties; Optical waveguides; Oxides; Semiconductor quantum dots; Silica; Silica gel; Visualization; 3-D image; Bulk materials; Color displays; Conventional materials; Depth cue; Fluorescent materials; Infrared laser beams; matrix; New material; Optical medium; Quantum Dot; Semiconductor nanocrystals; Silica aerogels; Theory and modeling; Transparent silica aerogel; Two beams; Ultra-light; Volumetric 3D; Volumetric display; Three dimensional","","The Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)","Three-Dimensional Imaging, Visualization, and Display 2010 and Display Technologies and Applications for Defense, Security, and Avionics IV","6 April 2010 through 8 April 2010","Orlando, FL","80941","0277786X","978-081948154-2","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77954406964"

With the advent of 3D visualization systems, these images can be put together into crisp and impressive renderings of the human body from a variety of perspectives that were only dreamt of before, revolutionizing clinical practice. Light transport models soon emerged to allow light interactions that, although not realistic in the physical sense, proved to be more effective for understanding the complex relationships among the anatomical structures. For instance, bone could be made semi-transparent to provide visibility of brain tissue. Skin could be removed altogether from an image to show only muscle or internal organs. However, soon it became evident that simply rendering these images in their raw form was no longer effective and the clear visualization of internal structures remains elusive. The depiction of internal parts in the context of the enclosing space is a difficult problem that has occupied the mind of artists, illustrators and visualization practitioners. Despite the advances made in computer graphics for simulating the light transport in semi-transparent media, the problem of visualizing internal objects is no longer a rendering problem, but that of classification. Medical imaging technology obtains representations of anatomical structures via indirect ways, such as the response of tissue to X-rays or the alignment of electrons in a magnetic field. Therefore, the absence of semantic information prevents visualization practitioners from clearly marking up the regions that must be visualized. Without access to those regions, exploration becomes tedious and time-consuming. The predominant approach has been the use of transfer functions, or opacity mappings, which assign transparency properties to different intervals in the data. This method, however, does not guarantee that internal structures are visible. Other strategies must be used. In this article, I describe some visualization techniques that have emerged to obtain clear views of internal features in 3D volume data.","","Biomagnetism; Data visualization; Magnetic field effects; Models; Three dimensional; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; 3-D visualization systems; Anatomical structures; Brain tissue; Clinical practices; Complex relationships; Human bodies; Internal features; Internal organs; Internal structure; Light interaction; Light transport; Light transport model; Medical imaging technology; Semantic information; Semi-transparent; Semitransparent media; Transparency properties; Visualization technique; Volume data; Medical imaging","","","","","","","00978930","","CGRAD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-77955929968"

The operator maintains the same rules for achromatic compositing as standard operators (such as the over operator), but it modifies the computation of the chromatic channels. Chromatic compositing aims at preserving the hue of the input colors; color continuity is achieved by reducing the saturation of colors that are to change their hue value. The main benefit of hue preservation is that color can be used for proper visual labeling, even under the constraint of transparency rendering or image overlays. Therefore, the visualization of nominal data is improved. Hue-preserving blending can be used in any existing compositing algorithm, and it is particularly useful for volume rendering. The usefulness of hue-preserving blending and its visual characteristics are shown for several examples of volume visualization. © 2009 IEEE.","color blending; illustrative visualization; Image compositing; perceptual transparency; volume rendering","Color; Computer Graphics; Diagnostic Imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Blending; Data visualization; Mathematical operators; Transparency; Visualization; Volume rendering; Chromatic channels; Color-blending; Compositing; Hue values; Illustrative visualization; Image compositing; Image overlay; Perceptual transparency; Volume visualization; article; color; computer graphics; diagnostic imaging; image processing; methodology; Color","","","","","","","10772626","","ITVGE","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-70350663226"

Apparently, the operational overhead of security outweighs its perceived benefits. Towards increasing the benefits versus overhead ratio we follow an approach that considers security and usability tradeoffs from the outset. We separate key exchange from binding keys to identities. The best effort key exchange and key maintenance scheme that we devise operates transparently for the user. We also describe complementary visualization and interaction techniques that communicate the security state of sent and received mail to users in a non-intrusive fashion. Structured interviews were conducted with 19 users to assess the usability of the metaphors and the complementary visualizations of the security state. Towards a practical assessment of the overheads of binding keys to identities, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 17 users' anonymized mailbox extracts to determine which security mechanisms would be most appropriate for their communication patterns. We argue that for individual non-commercial users, out-of-band verification of keys could be more economical than building trust in public key certificates issued by third parties. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Just noticeable distortion (JND), which refers to the maximum distortion that the HVS does not perceive, gives us a way to model the HVS accurately. In this paper, another very important aspect affecting human perception, visual saliency, is introduced to modulate JND profile. Based upon visual saliency's modulatory effect on JND profile which incorporates visual attention's influence on visual sensitivity, the saliency modulated JND model guided image watermarking scheme is proposed. Experimental results confirm the improved performance of our saliency modulated JND model. Our saliency modulated JND model is capable of shaping lower injected-watermark energy onto more sensitive regions and higher energy onto the less perceptually significant regions in the image, which yields better visual quality of the watermarked image. At the same time, the proposed saliency modulated JND model guided image watermarking scheme is more robust than unmodulated JND model guided image watermarking scheme while retaining the watermark transparency.","Image watermarking; Just noticeable distortion (JND); Visual saliency","Image processing; Visualization; Human perception; Human visual systems; Image Watermarking; Just noticeable distortion; Visual Attention; Visual qualities; Visual saliency; Visual sensitivity; Watermark transparency; Watermarked images; Watermarking","","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE); Inst.

Stereo vision is based on the principle that each eye is presented with the best possible image of what it would have seen if the object was really there in 3D. The simplest approach to stereo vision is to display the right eye picture on the right half of the screen and the left eye picture on the left half while using a mirror system to ensure that each eye sees what it ix supposed to see. More expensive workstations use hardware to alternately display the left and right eye pictures while synchronously blocking the transparency in the right or left lens of the special glasses worn by the user. We present here some simple software that uses inexpensive hardware, originally designed for the computer game industry, to make full screen stereo available on Linux-based PCs. The quality of the stereo vision is similar to the top-of-the-line graphics workstations that are capable of quad-buffering. This stereo option has been incorporated in the XII based version of WHAT IF (Vriend G. J. Mol.

Cells are fixed by glutaraldehyde and mounted in immersion liquid for reduction the influences of refraction.

Traditional approaches to canvas painting have included various paths of image preparation prior to the actual application of paint to canvas. Preliminary drawings and studies, photographs and graphing techniques have all been common approaches used for developing concepts for the final canvas painting. Many contemporary painters do not utilize preliminary concept studies for paintings at all, since the physical process, itself, can be a self-developing and self-revealing means to an end. This presentation will reveal this artist's approach to utilizing digital technology as a means for exploring ideas related to formal considerations of composition and color through image manipulation within Photoshop. Images that originate as original photographic studies from nature (most often in the form of landscape) are manipulated, printed as hard copy and used as source for the final paintings oh canvas. These canvas paintings are large in scale, measuring 60"" x 72"" as an average, and are executed within the synthetic acrylic medium. Occasionally, the hard-copy images are re-manipulated as collage pieces and/or re-scanned and re-processed through the software. The final paintings, however, are not totally predetermined by the digitized images. Alterations are made throughout the process of creating the paintings. Considerations of actual surface texture, color transparency, and numerous other characteristics not available for manipulation through image digitalization all partake and influence the final outcome. This presentation will include a slide representation of the entire process involved in creating the final paintings from the initial photographs, digitalization and the final, physical act of painting on canvas. The use of traditional materials within art making and the relationship of new technologies within that process is an important underlying issue within the presentation. © 2001 IEEE.","","Photography; Visualization; Color transparency; Digital technologies; Digitized images; Image manipulation; Painting on canvas; Photographic study; Traditional approaches; Traditional materials; Painting","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","5th International Conference on Information Visualisation, IV 2001","25 July 2001 through 27 July 2001","London","116444","10939547","0769511953","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84949227964"

To produce the stereoscopic image we render the component images in terms of degree of polarization, orienting the polarization axes of the left- and right-eye images at 90 degrees to one another. We print the two images on opposite surfaces of specially prepared substrates, using dichroic inks in otherwise standard desktop inkjet printers. Software provides accurate stereoscopic registration of the paired images. The process produces 3-D images as reflection prints or as transparencies. Observers view the superimposed image pair through standard 3- D polarizing glasses. Alternatively, autostereoscopic display apparatus permits viewing without glasses.

Differences in heated fluid flow patterns induced by laser drilling of a glycerol-water mixture under varying gravity conditions are presented to demonstrate an immediate application of the holographic technique. By imaging processes which possess cylindrical symmetry, the holographic imaging data can be reduced to temperature field data in a straightforward manner, which proves to be valuable for comparison with thermal modeling of the process.

Taking into account ambient, diffuse, and specular reflection terms as well as transparency, we employ a realistic shading model which significantly increases quality and realism of the resulting images. While many graphics workstations offer hardware support for illuminating surface primitives, usually no means for an accurate shading of line primitives are provided. However, we show that proper illumination of lines can be implemented by exploiting the texture mapping capabilities of modern graphics hardware. In this way high rendering performance with interactive frame rates can be achieved. We apply the technique to render large numbers of integral curves in a vector field. The impression of the resulting images can be further improved by making the curves partially transparent. We also describe methods for controlling the distribution of stream lines in space. These methods enable us to use illuminated stream lines within an interactive visualization environment.","","Computer simulation; Graphic methods; Lighting; Transparency; Vectors; Visualization; Interactive vector field visualization; Realistic shading model; Stream lines; Texture mapping; Interactive computer graphics","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference","27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996","San Francisco, CA, USA","45783","","","00106","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030412929"

The definition is ambiguous. There are points of space lying in several primitives, which can consist of different materials. When visualizing transparent objects this ambiguity leads to strange results, which are not consistent with the CSG modelling scheme and must therefore be eliminated. This work describes how an unambiguous model can be built by asymmetric CSG‐operators and how correct refraction and shading on material boundaries can be established by separating surface properties from material properties. This separation leads to a consistent view of CSG modelling also concerning materials and surfaces. Ray tracing CSG trees and the shading model are influenced by these asymmetric operators. We introduce an applied classification scheme to handle the requirements of the new operator definition. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

Examples from medical CT studies are given in contrast to the results from ray casting method both in image quality and in processing time.","","Computational methods; Computer hardware; Computer software; Computerized tomography; Data structures; Image processing; Image quality; Interactive computer graphics; Mathematical models; Personal computers; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Arbitrary viewing orientation; Boundary representation scheme; Direct volume rendering; Personal computer based quick algorithm; Semi transparent multiisosurfaces; Three dimensional scalar sample volumes; Volumetric data; Algorithms","IEEE","KCGS; CGS; POSTECH","Proceedings of the 1996 14th International Conference of the Computer Graphics Society, CGI'96","24 June 1996 through 28 June 1996","Pohang, South Korea","45188","","","00241","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029694663"

The basic idea is to generate and draw polygons simultaneously by processing the cells spanned by grids in decreasing order of distance from the current viewpoint. Iso‐surfaces are generated in five or six tetrahedrons into which the cells are subdivided, and are sent to a graphics device or drawn into a frame buffer on the fly. The execution order of each of the tetrahedrons is identical and is determined by the current viewpoint. Since the algorithm does not need to store intermediate polyhedral data and does not require a depth buffer memory for hidden surface removal, it is applicable to a large quantity of data on a 3D grid, such as computed tomography (CT) data. It is also particularly powerful for semi‐transparent display, because transparency calculation can be reduced to image compositing operations if the polygons are drawn in order of their z‐depth from the current viewpoint.

Examples include tissue and tumor boundaries in medical imaging, molecular surfaces and force thresholds in chemical and pharmaceutical applications, and isosurfaces in a wide range of 3D domains. The 3D shape of such surfaces can be particularly difficult to interpret because of the unfamiliar, irregular shapes, the potential concavities and bulges, and the lack of parallel lines and right angles to provide perspective depth cues. Attempts to display multiple irregular surfaces by making some or all of them transparent further complicates the problem. Texture can provide valuable cues to aid in the interpretation of irregular surfaces. Opacity-modulating textures offer a mechanism for the display of multiple surfaces without the extreme loss of clarity of multiple transparent surfaces. This paper presents a method for creating simple repeating textures and mapping them onto irregular surfaces.","","Computer simulation; Image quality; Medical imaging; Opacity; Visualization; Multiple transparent surfaces; Opacity modulating textures; Three dimensional computer graphics","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference","27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996","San Francisco, CA, USA","45783","","","00106","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030380950"

An interpretation without explicit analysis can be carried out by reflection/transmission (RT) volume rendering where voxels, depending on their surface probability, reflect and transmit light. Color coding voxels in RT rendering in order to attribute the surface to a specific object is not easy because the voxel value depends on the unknown objects meeting at the surface. This problem does not arise, if an emission/absorption (EA) method is applied. Emission and absorption of colored light are associated with the probability of a voxel belonging to a certain object. We combined both approaches to exploit the RT renderer's ability to reveal surface details and the EA renderer's ability to differentiate objects. A user-defined operator decides whether a voxel belongs to the background, to a surface, or to an object. Background voxels are skipped. Object voxels contribute to accumulated light emission. Surface voxels reflect light from an outside light source. Color is attributed only to object voxels, but it is possible to let colored object voxels shine through semi-transparent surface voxels. CT sequences were visualized in order to display structures such as the ventricular system or areas of pathological processes. Although the differentiation of these structures was not complete, the display showed enough detail to convey the relevant shape to the user. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Emission/absorption rendering; Front-to-back projection; Image analysis; Image display; Medical imaging; Reflection/transmission rendering; Volume rendering","Data visualization; Image analysis; Light; Light sources; Lighting; Probability; Programming theory; Three dimensional; Volume rendering; Computerized tomography; Digital image storage; Display devices; Visualization; Color coding voxels; Image display; Reflection/transmission volume rendering; Three dimensional medical data; 3D medical datums; Colored lights; Data sets; Emission/absorption rendering; Explicit analysis; Front-to-back projection; Function values; Image display; Pathological processes; Reflection/transmission rendering; Surface details; Transparent surfaces; Unknown objects; Ventricular systems; Medical imaging","","","Medical Imaging 1996: Image Display","11 February 1996 through 11 February 1996","Newport Beach, CA","74657","0277786X","","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029712811"

However, in computer-generated pictures - as in photographs and in directly viewed actual objects - it can often be difficult to adequately perceive the three-dimensional shape of a layered transparent surface or its relative depth distance from underlying structures. Inspired by artists' use of line to show shape, we have explored methods for automatically defining a distributed set of opaque surface markings that intend to portray the three-dimensional shape and relative depth of a smoothly curving layered transparent surface in an intuitively meaningful (and minimally occluding) way. This paper describes the perceptual motivation, artistic inspiration and practical implementation of an algorithm for `texturing' a transparent surface with uniformly distributed opaque short strokes, locally oriented in the direction of greatest normal curvature, and of length proportional to the magnitude of the surface curvature in the stroke direction. The driving application for this work is the visualization of layered surfaces in radiation therapy treatment planning data, and the technique is illustrated on transparent isointensity surfaces of radiation dose.","","Algorithms; Automation; Computer simulation; Image quality; Radiotherapy; Surfaces; Visualization; Opaque short strokes; Surface curvature; Transparent surfaces; Three dimensional computer graphics","IEEE","IEEE","Proceedings of the 1996 IEEE Visualization Conference","27 October 1996 through 1 November 1996","San Francisco, CA, USA","45783","","","00106","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0030400447"

Our system moves all the computations necessary for order-independent transparency and volume scan conversion from the CPU to the graphics hardware, and it makes a software sorting pass unnecessary. It therefore provides the same advantages for volume data that triangle-processing hardware provides for surfaces. To address a remaining bottleneck - the bandwidth between main memory and the graphics processor - we introduce two new primitives, tetrahedral strips and tetrahedral fans. These primitives allow performance improvements in rendering tetrahedral meshes similar to the improvements triangle strips and fans allow in rendering triangle meshes. We provide new techniques for generating tetrahedral strips that achieve, on the average, strip lengths of 17 on representative datasets. The combined effect of our architecture and new primitives is a 72 to 85 times increase in performance over triangle graphics hardware approaches. These improvements make it possible to use volumetric tetrahedral meshes in interactive applications. © VG 2001.

This technique consists of two components: visualization and navigation. Visualization uses a fast enclosure + connection method to calculate the geometrical layout for the display of large hierarchies in a two-dimensional space. Our technique uses a rectangular division algorithm for recursively positioning the graph. This visualization aims to maximize the utilization of display space while retaining a good geometrical layout as well as a clear (explicit) presentation of the hierarchical structure of graphs. This paper also presents an experimental evaluation of EncCon's layout algorithm. Besides the layout algorithm, EncCon uses a new focus + context viewing technique for the navigation of large hierarchies. We use the zooming + layering concept to achieve the focus + context viewing, rather than the traditional enlarge + embedded concept, which is used by most of the available focus + context techniques. Technically, it employs semi-transparency to achieve the display of two layers of information in z-coordination at the same visualization. Both context view and detail view are drawn at two separate layers. These layers are then displayed in an overlapped manner at the same physical screen space. © 2005, SAGE Publications.

Image quality is adversely affected by the presence of fluctuations of air temperature in the light path. In an ideal telescope enclosure, the air inside the telescope chamber is continually replaced by ambient air before it has the opportunity to be warmed or cooled by the surfaces of the telescope enclosure. In this study, we use dye in a water tunnel to trace flow around and through four models of 8 m telescope enclosures. The models are constructed of transparent acrylic and are 1:172 scale. We differentially compare flow attributes for the four enclosure designs under consideration. The enclosure models are oriented at various angles with respect to the flow direction. Additionally, each design contains apertures in the exterior walls which can be opened to improve flushing and other flow characteristics. For the octagonal and rectangular designs, flushing of the telescope chamber through the open vents is good in all orientations. Flushing of the cylindrical concept, which has no vents in its side walls, is poor when the slit is oriented from 60° to 120° with respect to the flow direction. Flushing of the hemispherical enclosure is poor at angles larger than 60°. With the vents closed, flushing is poor for all designs, especially at angles greater than 60°. We find in the case of the hemispherical and octagonal designs, that aerodynamic lift over the upper part of the slit opening causes fluid to be flushed from the telescope chamber over the telescope even with open vents in the leeward wall. This effect is much less pronounced in the case of the flat roof topologies which generate less lift.","","Aerodynamics; Flow of Fluids - Visualization; 8 m Telescope Enclosure; Image Quality; Light Path; Telescope Chamber; Telescope Enclosure; Transparent Acrylic; Telescopes","Publ by Int Soc for Optical Engineering","SPIE; American Astronomical Soc; Imperial Coll of Science, Technology & Medicine, Blackett Lab; Chinese Astronomical Soc; Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, W Ger; et al","Advanced Technology Optical Telescopes IV","12 February 1990 through 16 February 1990","Tuscon, AZ, USA","13854","0277786X","081940280X","PSISD","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0025672272"

This paper describes a new ray-casting algorithm that employs the concept of progressive refinement for volume rendering. Volume data are embedded into a complete octree, and when the volume data are rendered, the octree is traversed according to a user-defined threshold. By reducing this threshold gradually, we can render increasingly refined images. Ray-casting is used to explore the octree, and a data structure called a sample buffer (SB) is introduced to reduce the time required to render a series of images. With this method, a satisfactory balance between image quality and computation time can be achieved. © 1993.","","Algorithms; Color; Image processing; Image quality; Interpolation; Opacity; Transfer functions; Transparency; Visualization; Ray casting algorithm; Sample buffer; Volume data rendering; Volume visualization; Three dimensional computer graphics","","","","","","","00978493","","COGRD","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0027590525"
