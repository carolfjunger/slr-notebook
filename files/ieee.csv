As datasets grow increasingly large in both number of event sequences and number of event types, two problems arise: how to group event types, and how to describe selection bias that can occur when selecting cohorts. This poster summarizes two papers, conditionally accepted to VAST, that introduce a dynamic and interactive algorithm for hierarchical event grouping, a scented scatter-plus-focus visualization that supports hierarchical exploration, a tree-based cohort provenance visualization, and a set of visualizations that provide per-dimension selection bias information for pairs of cohorts [2, 4]. These methods are integrated into the web-based interactive medical analysis tool Cadence.","","978-1-7281-2423-0","10.1109/VAHC47919.2019.8945029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945029","Temporal event sequence visualization;visual analytics;hierarchical aggregation;medical informatics;high-dimensional visualization;cohort selection;selection bias","Data visualization;Pain;Obesity;Tools;Visualization;Correlation;Sleep apnea","","1","","7","IEEE","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yamane",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Ethics of the Algorithm: Digital Humanities and Holocaust Memory,"","2024","","","","","How computational methods can expand how we see, read, and listen to Holocaust testimonyThe Holocaust is one of the most documented—and now digitized—events in human history. Institutions and archives hold hundreds of thousands of hours of audio and video testimony, composed of more than a billion words in dozens of languages, with millions of pieces of descriptive metadata. It would take several lifetimes to engage with these testimonies one at a time. Computational methods could be used to analyze an entire archive—but what are the ethical implications of “listening” to Holocaust testimonies by means of an algorithm? In this book, Todd Presner explores how the digital humanities can provide both new insights and humanizing perspectives for Holocaust memory and history.Presner suggests that it is possible to develop an “ethics of the algorithm” that mediates between the ethical demands of listening to individual testimonies and the interpretative possibilities of computational methods. He delves into thousands of testimonies and witness accounts, focusing on the analysis of trauma, language, voice, genre, and the archive itself. Tracing the affordances of digital tools that range from early, proto-computational approaches to more recent uses of automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, Presner introduces readers to what may be the ultimate expression of these methods: AI-driven testimonies that use machine learning to process responses to questions, offering a user experience that seems to replicate an actual conversation with a Holocaust survivor.With Ethics of the Algorithm, Presner presents a digital humanities argument for how big data models and computational methods can be used to preserve and perpetuate cultural memory.","","9780691258980","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10614711.pdf&bkn=10614710&pdfType=book","AI;algorithmic fabulation;archive;big data;cultural analytics;datafication;digital culture;digital media;digital technologies;ethical computation;Ethics of the Algorithm: Digital Humanities and Holocaust Memory;humanistic data science;natural language processing;survivor;Testimony;Todd Presner;virtual;witness;Data;Survivors;Narrative;Algorithm;Holocaust;Jewish;Human;Triplets;USC Shoah foundation;Mala;Jews;Visualization;Digital;Ethical;Semantic;Algorithmic;Memory;Ethics;Nazi;Database;Kimmelmann;Auschwitz;Corpus;War;Death;Trauma;Dimensions in Testimony (DiT);Network;Semantic triplets;History;Holocaust testimony;Judgment;Distant;Technologies;Cultural;Segments;Processes;Violence;Victims;Child;Population;Dutch;Fortunoff;Bomba;Ghetto;Silence;Media;Machine learning;Clusters;Police;Labor;Technology","","","","","","","30 Jul 2024","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Visualization quality of such point clouds highly depends on density distributional uniformity, that is, the uniformity of the inter-point distances. The visualization quality can be improved by making point distances uniform. In addition, the visibility further improves by emphasizing edges. In this study, first the uniformity and flexible tuning of the point density based on Poisson disk sampling are examined. The resultant high-quality point clouds are then applied to transparent visualization.

However, we have yet to develop visualization techniques that optimally convey the inner structure of complex transparent shapes. In this paper, we apply the findings of perception research to develop a novel illustrative rendering method that enhances surface transparency nonlocally. Rendering of transparent geometry is computationally expensive since many optimizations, such as visibility culling, are not applicable and fragments have to be sorted by depth for correct blending. In order to overcome these difficulties efficiently, we propose the illustration buffer. This novel data structure combines the ideas of the A and G-buffers to store a list of all surface layers for each pixel. A set of local and nonlocal operators is then used to process these depth-lists to generate the final image. Our technique is interactive on current graphics hardware and is only limited by the available graphics memory. Based on this framework, we present an efficient algorithm for a nonlocal transparency enhancement that creates expressive renderings of transparent surfaces. A controlled quantitative double blind user study shows that the presented approach improves the understanding of complex transparent surfaces significantly.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6244795","Illustrative rendering;transparency;flow visualization;integral surface;user study;diffusion;a-buffer;illustration buffer;perception","Rendering (computer graphics);Buffer storage;Image color analysis;Surface treatment;Indexes;Graphics processing unit","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Reproducibility of Results;Rheology;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface","21","","41","IEEE","19 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is not possible today for an individual to be sure that what s/he has shared is exactly what s/he wants to be shared and to whom. Individuals have no control over their Big Data (BiDa) before it is released “in the wild”. With the use of more and more devices and applications generating great amounts of individuals' data, each one of us is bound to be drawn in our BiDa. On the other hand, users' personal BiDa can potentially be a useful source of information to better understand what data are used for each individual's interaction profile and, when we know this, what are the most adequate measures to protect that data. Thus, we can better tame what we better know. Current access control models need to take this challenge on board because system's privacy and security controls are more likely to be compromised due to the misconfiguration or inadequate access control policies rather than the failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This paper presents TagUBig - Taming Your Big Data, a framework to control and improve transparency, privacy, availability and usability when users interact with applications. The framework comprises components that can face some of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) key challenges regarding personal data protection, which are introduced in the paper. A healthcare proof of concept use-case scenario is also presented together with the description and discussion of the features that have already been developed and tested.

Despite that, we are still far from reaching fully the goal of transparency. Due to the lack of a shared protocol, each administration is free to choose the format to publish and present the data, resulting in a proliferation of different formats, different website structures and table of contents, which makes the exploration and discovering of facts and figures harder. Transparency without accessibility, is a lost opportunity. The paper will discuss these issues in the light of a new design and data storytelling oriented paradigm, intended to turn the mere online publication of data into a more engaging and immersive experience.

The task of studying such encoded representations is referred to as model interpretation. Efforts along this direction, despite being proved efficient, stand with two weaknesses. First, there is low semanticity on the feedback they provide which leads toward subjective visualizations. Second, there is no unified protocol for the quantitative evaluation of interpretation methods which makes the comparison between current and future methods complex.To address these issues, we propose a unified evaluation protocol for the quantitative evaluation of interpretation methods. This is achieved by enhancing existing interpretation methods to be capable of generating visual explanations and then linking these explanations with a semantic label. To achieve this, we introduce the Weighted Average Intersection-over-Union (WAIoU) metric to estimate the coverage rate between explanation heatmaps and semantic annotations. This is complemented with an analysis of several binarization techniques for heatmaps, necessary when measuring coverage. Experiments considering several interpretation methods covering different CNN architectures pre-trained on multiple datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.","2642-9381","978-1-6654-9346-8","10.1109/WACV56688.2023.00147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10030980","Algorithms: Explainable;fair;accountable;privacy-preserving;ethical computer vision;Visualization","Heating systems;Measurement;Visualization;Computer vision;Protocols;Semantics;Computer architecture","","","","27","IEEE","6 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While traditional perturbation methods make only use of occlusions to explain the model predictions, OSA-DAS extends standard occlusion sensitivity analysis by enabling the integration with diverse image augmentations. Distinctly, our method utilizes the output vector of a DNN to build low-dimensional subspaces within the deep feature vector space, offering a more precise explanation of the model prediction. The structural similarity between these subspaces encompasses the influence of diverse augmentations and occlusions. We test extensively on the ImageNet-1k, and our class- and model-agnostic approach outperforms commonly used interpreters, setting it apart in the realm of explainable AI.","2642-9381","979-8-3503-1892-0","10.1109/WACV57701.2024.00476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10483645","Algorithms;Explainable;fair;accountable;privacy-preserving;ethical computer vision;Algorithms;Image recognition and understanding;Applications;Visualization","Analytical models;Computer vision;Sensitivity analysis;Computational modeling;Perturbation methods;Neural networks;Predictive models","","","","42","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865233","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8440809","Decision making;cognitive bias;bias alleviation;bias mitigation;debiasing;information visualization;attraction effect","Data visualization;Training;Decision making;Cognition;Visualization;Task analysis","","30","","98","IEEE","20 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threaten the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process.

Evidence is collected, collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467591","EU project Visual Analytics for Sensemaking in Criminal Intelligence Analysis (VALCRI)(grant numbers:FP7-SEC-2013-608142,SPP 1335); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7192716","Visual Analytics;Knowledge Generation;Uncertainty Measures and Propagation;Trust Building;Human Factors;Visual Analytics;Knowledge Generation;Uncertainty Measures and Propagation;Trust Building;Human Factors","Uncertainty;Data visualization;Visual analytics;Data models;Buildings;Analytical models","Awareness;Computer Graphics;Human Engineering;Humans;Trust;Uncertainty","174","","83","IEEE","12 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, we developed an interactive visualization system called RMExplorer (Risk Model Explorer) to enable interactive risk model assessment. Specifically, the system allows users to define subgroups of patients by selecting clinical, demographic, or other characteristics, to ex-plore the performance and fairness of risk models on the subgroups, and to understand the feature contributions to risk scores. To demonstrate the usefulness of the tool, we conduct a case study, where we use RMExplorer to explore three atrial fibrillation risk models by applying them to the UK Biobank dataset of 445,329 individuals.

Visual analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g. tens of thousands of distinct codes in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias–when the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort provenance and visualization, including a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are compared against, and visual encoding of cohort “drift”, which indicates where selection bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization, to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus cohort.

Exploiting this weakness, a seller can build high reputation by selling cheap products while cheating on the expensive ones. In the recent years, multiple approaches have been introduced that address this challenge. All of them chose metrics leading to numerical reputation values. These values, however, are non-transparent and quite hard to understand for the end-user. In this work, in contrast, we combine reputation assessment and visual analytics to provide an interactive visualization of multivariate reputation data.

To fill this gap, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, we explored how chart type, topic, and user goal impacted which categories of metadata participants deemed most relevant. We presented 64 participants with four real-world visualizations. For each visualization, participants were given four goals and selected the type of metadata they most wanted from a set of 18 types. Our results indicated that participants were most interested in metadata which explained the visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding and metadata about the source of the data for assessing trustworthiness. In Experiment 2, we explored how these two types of metadata impact transparency, trustworthiness and persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding. We asked 144 participants to explain the main message of two pairs of visualizations (one with metadata and one without); rate them on scales of transparency and relevance; and then predict the likelihood that they were selected for a presentation to policymakers. Our results suggested that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough than those without metadata, but similarly relevant, accurate, clear, and complete. Additionally, we found that metadata did not impact the accuracy of the information extracted from visualizations, but may have influenced which information participants remembered as important or interesting.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3231716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9998319","Metadata;trust;transparency;understanding;visualization","Data visualization;Metadata;Encoding;Soft sensors;Stakeholders;Organizations;Data mining","","6","","104","IEEE","23 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such bias can be mitigated by incorporating both objective as well as subjective (through human users) measures of bias, and compensating for them by means of a suitable selection algorithm over subgroups of training data. In this paper, we propose a methodology of integrating bias detection and mitigation strategies through interactive visualization of machine learning models in selected protected spaces. In this approach, a (partially generated) ML model performance is visualized and evaluated by a human user or a community of human users in terms of potential presence of bias using both objective and subjective criteria. Guided by such human feedback, the ML algorithm can implement a variety of remedial sampling strategies to mitigate the bias using an iterative human-in-the-loop approach.

However, due to cultural and perceptual biases, such metrics are often not powerful enough to accurately capture what people perceive as fair or unfair. To close the gap between human judgement and automated fairness evaluation, we develop a mixed-initiative system named FairAlign, where laypeople assess the fairness of different classification models by analyzing expressive and interactive visualizations of data. Using the aggregated qualitative feedback, data scientists and machine learning experts can examine the similarities and the differences between predefined fairness metrics and human judgement in a contextualized setting. To validate the utility of our system, we conducted a small study on a socially relevant classification task, where six people were asked to assess the fairness of multiple prediction models using the provided visualizations. The results show that our platform is able to give valuable guidance for model evaluation in case of otherwise contradicting and indecisive metrics for algorithmic fairness.","","978-1-6654-9356-7","10.1109/TREX57753.2022.00005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9974353","Algorithmic-fairness;Fairness-assessment;FairAlign;Visual-analytics-system;Human-judgement;Mixed-initiative;Contextualized-fairness","Measurement;Analytical models;Visual analytics;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Data models","","1","","36","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the advent of a new era of high-speed telecommunication services, mobile users have evolved to a large extent demanding secure, private, and trustworthy services. Online social networks have evolved as pervasive online social networks (POSNs), which uses a common platform to connect users from hybrid applications. Trust has always been a concern for these networks. However, existing approaches tend to provide application-specific trust management, thus resulting in the cost of excessive network resource utilization and high computations. In this paper, a pervasive trust management framework is presented for POSNs, which is capable of generating high trust value between the users with a lower cost of monitoring. The proposed approach uses a flexible mixture model to develop the system around six different properties, and then utilizes the concept of osmotic computing to perform computational offloading, which reduces the number of computations as well as computational time. The novel concepts of lock door policy and intermediate state management procedure are used to allow trust visualization by providing efficient identification of trustworthy and untrustworthy users. The proposed approach is capable of predicting user ratings efficiently with extremely low errors, which are in the range of ±2. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using theoretical and numerical analyses along with data set-based simulations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2683159","Human Resource Training Program for Regional Innovation and Creativity through the Ministry of Education and National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2014H1C1A1073115); Soonchunhyang University Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883896","Pervasive social networks;online social networks;trust management;osmotic computing;trust visualization","Social network services;Monitoring;Mobile communication;Peer-to-peer computing;Mixture models;Reliability;Mathematical model","","38","","32","OAPA","21 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decision-making. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users’ interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis.

Criminal analysts often use visual analytics environments for their analysis of large data sets, for gaining insights on criminal events and patterns of criminal events, and for drawing conclusions and making decisions. However, due to the nature of human cognition, these cognitive processes may lead to systematic errors, so-called cognitive biases. The most prominent and relevant cognitive bias in the intelligence field is the confirmation bias, in which an analyst disproportionally considers and selects information that supports the initial expectation and hypothesis. The framework presented in this paper describes a model, how the possible occurence of the confirmation bias can be detected automatically, while the analyst makes use of the visual environment. Moreover, based on this information, different feedback methods are employed that support and encourage the mitigation of the confirmation bias.

A term of ethical AI has emerged, and numerous national, European and global guidelines have recently been published, in the hope of creating a unified framework set to be used and implemented across EU and the globe.However, a highly convoluted nature of legislative procedures regarding emerging technologies makes it increasingly complicated to map out ethical AI properties and guidelines. Hence, a holistic and data-driven approach towards AI policy-making is proposed. In order to help EU policymakers and lawmakers, ethical AI principles of explainability and autonomy will be contextualized and visualized. Data contextualization is achieved using secondary datasets based on the systematic literature review, while data visualization is implemented in a form of a compact digital dashboard, using Python programming language and its associated visualization libraries.Goal of the suggested comprehensive solution is to simplify and streamline future decision processes regarding AI topics exclusively from policymakers’ perspective.

In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios.

This survey assesses the state of the art in scientific literature of the usability of ex post TETs enhancing privacy and discusses them in terms of their common features and unique characteristics. The article first defines the scope of usable transparency in terms of relevant privacy principles for providing transparency by taking the GDPR as a point of reference, and usability principles that are important for achieving transparency. These principles for usable transparency serve as a reference for classifying and assessing the surveyed TETs. The retrieval and screening process of the publications is then described, as is the process for deriving the subsequent classification of the characteristics of the TETs. The survey not only looks into what is made transparent by the TETs but also how transparency is actually achieved. A main contribution of this survey is a proposed classification that assesses the TETs based on their functionality, implementation and evaluation as described in the literature. It concludes by discussing the trends and limitations of the surveyed TETs in regard to the defined scope of usable TETs and shows possible directions of future research for addressing these gaps.

The main benefit of hue preservation is that color can be used for proper visual labeling, even under the constraint of transparency rendering or image overlays.

This presents a challenge for volume rendering methods to produce images with unambiguous depth-ordering perception. Existing methods use visual cues such as halos and shadows to enhance depth perception. Along with other limitations, these methods introduce redundant information and require additional overhead. This paper presents a new approach to enhancing depth-ordering perception of volume rendered images without using additional visual cues. We set up an energy function based on quantitative perception models to measure the quality of the images in terms of the effectiveness of depth-ordering and transparency perception as well as the faithfulness of the information revealed. Guided by the function, we use a conjugate gradient method to iteratively and judiciously enhance the results. Our method can complement existing systems for enhancing volume rendering results. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226392","Volume rendering;depth ordering;depth perception;transparency;visualization","Rendering (computer graphics);Junctions;Image color analysis;Transfer functions;Visualization;Optimization;Solid modeling","Algorithms;Computer Graphics;Depth Perception;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;User-Computer Interface","25","","40","IEEE","26 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rendering of transparent lines is widely used for visualizing trajectories of tracer particles in flow fields. Transparency is then used to fade out lines deemed unimportant, based on, for instance, geometric properties or attributes defined along with them. Accurate blending of transparent lines requires rendering the lines in back-to-front or front-to-back order, yet enforcing this order for space-filling 3D line sets with extremely high-depth complexity becomes challenging. In this article, we study CPU and GPU rendering techniques for transparent 3D line sets. We compare accurate and approximate techniques using optimized implementations and several benchmark data sets. We discuss the effects of data size and transparency on quality, performance, and memory consumption. Based on our study, we propose two improvements to per-pixel fragment lists and multi-layer alpha blending. The first improves the rendering speed via an improved GPU sorting operation, and the second improves rendering quality via transparency-based bucketing.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.2975795","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9007507","Scientific visualization;line rendering;order-independent transparency","Rendering (computer graphics);Ray tracing;Three-dimensional displays;Graphics processing units;Complexity theory;Acceleration;Image color analysis","","10","","44","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An important means of giving feedback to an operator is the visualization of the internal processes of a system. In this position paper we address the problem of visualizing dynamic processes especially in self-learning systems. We take an existing self-learning system from the field of computer vision as an example from which we derive questions of general interest such as possible options to visualize the flow of information in a dynamic learning system or the visualization of symbolic data. As a side effect the visualization of learning processes may provide a better understanding of underlying principles of learning in general, i.e, also in biological systems.

Since the ultimate responsibility lies in the operators, it is crucial that they trust and know how to configure and use these systems, as well as have a good understanding of their inner workings, strengths and limitations. To limit the negative effects of inadequate cooperation between the operators and their support systems, this paper presents a design proposal that aims at making the threat evaluation process more transparent. We focus on the initialization, configuration and preparation phases of the threat evaluation process, supporting the user in the analysis of the behavior of the system considering the relevant parameters involved in the threat estimations.

Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations.

This paper introduces a solution named EnsembleCAM to enhance interpretability by unifying visual explanations through the combination of diverse Class Activation Maps (CAMs). Using the Herlev Dataset, we employ data pre-processing, data augmentation techniques, develop an XceptionNet based binary classification model with an accuracy of 89% and apply GradCAM, GradCAM++, Score-CAM, Eigen-CAM and LayerCAM on this classifier. Then, the novel EnsembleCAM is constructed taking the median of activation maps from the five individual CAM methods. The analysis of activation maps of each CAM method and EnsembleCAM confirmed that in activation maps of EnsembleCAM, higher activation values were more concentrated around the nucleus which is the most important region in indicating cervical malignancy. The evaluation using pixel flipping performance metric also proved that the EnsembleCAM effectively recognises regions vital to the model's decision-making through its steepest drop in the mean prediction score when the pixels in the region contributing most to the model's decision were flipped.","2613-8662","979-8-3503-7568-8","10.1109/SCSE61872.2024.10550859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550859","class activation maps;ensemble explanations;explainable artificial intelligence;medical image classification;transparent classification visualization","Visualization;Decision making;Closed box;Predictive models;Cams;Reliability;Medical diagnosis","","1","","24","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the graph mining community in particular, an important goal toward algorithmic fairness is to detect and mitigate bias incorporated into graph embeddings since they are commonly used in human-centered applications, e.g., social-media recommendations. However, simple analytical methods for detecting bias typically involve aggregate statistics which do not reveal the sources of unfairness. Instead, visual methods can provide a holistic fairness characterization of graph embeddings and help uncover the causes of observed bias. In this work, we present BIASCOPE, an interactive visualization tool that supports end-to-end visual unfairness diagnosis for graph embeddings. The tool is the product of a design study in collaboration with domain experts. It allows the user to (i) visually compare two embeddings with respect to fairness, (ii) locate nodes or graph communities that are unfairly embedded, and (iii) understand the source of bias by interactively linking the relevant embedding subspace with the corresponding graph topology. Experts’ feedback confirms that our tool is effective at detecting and diagnosing unfairness. Thus, we envision our tool both as a companion for researchers in designing their algorithms as well as a guide for practitioners who use off-the-shelf graph embeddings.","","978-1-6654-5721-7","10.1109/VDS57266.2022.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9980579","Graph embeddings;network visualization;algorithmic fairness","Visualization;Machine learning algorithms;Systematics;Data visualization;Collaboration;Machine learning;Topology","","","","64","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing taxonomies are organized by cognitive theories that are hard to associate with visualization tasks. Based on a survey of the literature we propose a task-based taxonomy of 154 cognitive biases organized in 7 main categories.

Since visualizations can be used to support decision making - e.g., when choosing a house to buy or an employee to hire - a systematic bias could have important implications. In a first crowdsource experiment, we indeed partially replicated the attraction effect with three alternatives presented as a numerical table, and observed similar effects when they were presented as a scatterplot. In a second experiment, we investigated if the effect extends to larger sets of alternatives, where the number of alternatives is too large for numerical tables to be practical. Our findings indicate that the bias persists for larger sets of alternatives presented as scatterplots.

In other words, humans judge class separability of the same scatterplot differently depending on the scatterplot(s) they have seen before. These findings inform future work on better understanding and more accurately modeling human perception of visual patterns.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744138","German Research Council DFG; FFG(grant numbers:845898); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8022891","Perception;Anchoring;Bias;Scatterplots;Visualization;MTurk Study","Data visualization;Visualization;Visual perception;Correlation;Cognition;Data models;Uncertainty","Bias;Crowdsourcing;Databases, Factual;Humans;Models, Psychological;Psychological Tests;Repetition Priming;Research Design;Visual Perception","51","","66","IEEE","30 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But that means that two people can see different patterns in the same visualization, potentially leading to miscommunication. Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that naïve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice. The present findings show that the curse of knowledge also plagues the visual perception of data, explaining why people can fail to connect with audiences when they communicate patterns in data.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2917689","Northwestern Cognitive Science Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8718533","Cognitive biases;data communication;expertise;information visualization;perception and cognition","Data visualization;Visualization;Psychology;Decision making;Data communication;Data mining;Cognition","","43","","47","IEEE","20 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When datasets are unrepresentative, trained models are prone to bias because they are unable to generalise to real world settings. This is particularly problematic for models trained in specific cultural contexts, which may not represent a wide range of races, and thus fail to generalise. This is a particular challenge for driver drowsiness detection, where many publicly available datasets are unrepresentative as they cover only certain ethnicity groups. Traditional augmentation methods are unable to improve a model's performance when tested on other groups with different facial attributes, and it is often challenging to build new, more representative datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that boosts the performance of detection of drowsiness for different ethnicity groups. Our framework improves Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for prediction by using Generative Adversarial networks (GAN) for targeted data augmentation based on a population bias visualisation strategy that groups faces with similar facial attributes and highlights where the model is failing. A sampling method selects faces where the model is not performing well, which are used to fine-tune the CNN. Experiments show the efficacy of our approach in improving driver drowsiness detection for under represented ethnicity groups. Here, models trained on publicly available datasets are compared with a model trained using the proposed data augmentation strategy. Although developed in the context of driver drowsiness detection, the proposed framework is not limited to the driver drowsiness detection task, but can be applied to other applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2981912","University of Kwa-Zulu Natal; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9042231","Population bias;GAN;visualisation;CNN","Generative adversarial networks;Vehicles;Training;Sociology;Statistics;Computer architecture;Task analysis","","27","","51","CCBY","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization – while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3051013","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1527765,1564049,1513651,1452977,1845638); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(grant numbers:FA8750-17-2-0107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320596","Progressive visualization;cognitive bias","Data visualization;Uncertainty;Bars;Task analysis;Real-time systems;Query processing;Data analysis","Bias;Cognition;Computer Graphics;Uncertainty","9","","53","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unfortunately, the choice of the most appropriate estimation technique is not a trivial task, due to the multi-faceted nature of error. Accuracy, bias and variance are notions describing different aspects of predictive power that someone has to take into consideration during the validation process. The main objective of this paper is the utilization of visual analytics for the evaluation of two fundamental ingredients of prediction accuracy: the bias and the variance. Through a bootstrap-based resampling algorithm, we provide an easy-to-interpret way in order to acquire significant knowledge about the quality of a prediction candidate and manage the uncertainty of the estimation process.

Indeed, any misinterpretation or flaw in the outputs of Data Analytics results can cause significant damage, specialy when dealing with one of the most often overlooked issues, namely the unaware use of biased data. When data bias goes unadverted, it warps the meaning of data, having a devastating effect on Data Analytics results. Although it is widely argued that the most common manner to deal with data bias is to rebalance biased datasets, it is not an aseptic transformation, leading to several potentially undesired side-effects that will probably harm the result of data analyses. Therefore, in order to analyze the underlying bias in datasets, in this work we present (i) a comprehensive methodology based on visualization techniques, which assists users in the definition of their analytical requirements to detect and visually represent the data bias automatically helping them to find out whether it is appropriate to artificially rebalance their dataset or not; (ii) a novel metamodel for visually representing bias; (iii) a motivating real-world running example used to analyze the impact of bias in Data Analytics and (iv) an assessment of the improvements introduced by our proposal through a complete real-world case study by using a Fire Department Calls for Service dataset, thus demonstrating that rebalancing datasets is not always the best option.

We found that there are great mismatches between users' perception and actual quality of motifs when sequence logos were used as an evaluation metric.

We introduce a basic methodology for calculating Trust, which is later extended through clustering of malicious events. Based on the proposed methodology, a GUI is implemented that allows the quick and easy visualization of malicious behavior with the corresponding trust calculation. Overall, this work aims to support existing trust models in terms of aggregating behavior and translating it into trustworthiness.","2378-4873","978-1-7281-1016-5","10.1109/CAMAD.2019.8858434","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858434","behavior;visualization;trust","Mathematical model;Internet of Things;Measurement;Computer hacking;5G mobile communication;Graphical user interfaces","","2","","13","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts: single quantile dotplot (1-Dotplot), dual quantile dotplots (2-Dotplot), dual histogram intervals (2-Interval), and Plinko quantile dotplot (Plinko), an animated design with a physical and probabilistic analogy. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022, to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We use Bayesian multilevel modeling and post-stratification to produce demographically-representative estimates of people's emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people's intentions to participate in elections. 2-Interval shows the strongest effects across all measures; 1-Dotplot increases trust the most after elections. Both visualizations create emotional and trust gaps between different partisan identities, especially when a Republican candidate is predicted to win. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization. This intriguing interplay between visualization types, partisanship, and trust exemplifies the fundamental challenge of disentangling visualization from its context, underscoring a need for deeper investigation into the real-world impacts of visualizations.

We address this gap by proposing a comprehensive, multidimensional conceptualization and operationalization of trust in visualization. We do this by applying general theories of trust from social sciences, as well as synthesizing and extending earlier work and factors identified by studies in the visualization field. We apply a two-dimensional approach to trust in visualization, to distinguish between cognitive and affective elements, as well as between visualization and data-specific trust antecedents. We use our framework to design and run a large crowd-sourced study to quantify the role of visual complexity in establishing trust in science visualizations.

In this paper, we seek to understand another aspect of ML interpretability: how the presence of classification probabilities affects users' trust in the model outcomes, especially in ambiguous instances. To this end, we conducted an online survey in which we asked participants to evaluate their agreement with an automatic classification made by an ML model before and after presenting them the model classification probabilities.

To alleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that embodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social biases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent causal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to inject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a group, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair causal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness metrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by refining the causal model and acting on the unfair causal edges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the system uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the current causal model while ensuring a minimal change from the original dataset. Users can visually assess the impact of their interactions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion, and the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the debiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer predictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and also a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly compared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics while incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover, our human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated approach on trust, interpretability and accountability.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209484","NSF(grant numbers:CNS 1900706,IIS 1527200,IIS 1941613); NSF(grant numbers:1926949); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903601","Algorithmic Fairness;Causality;Debiasing;Human-in-the-loop;Visual Analytics","Measurement;Visualization;Mathematical models;Human in the loop;Distortion;Data models;Machine learning algorithms","Female;Humans;Computer Graphics;Causality;Algorithms;Machine Learning;Bias","11","","50","IEEE","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, algorithm developers need tools that can help them uncover potential biases in their models while also exploring the impacts of correcting for biases when employing fairness-aware algorithms. In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms.

A fundamental challenge of FL is non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data, which can be addressed by clustered FL (CFL) that explores inherent partitions among clients to capture heterogeneous local data distributions. Existing CFL methods, however, tend to optimise the mean accuracy across all clients, overlooking the important issue of fairness, that is, uniformity of clients' performance. Besides, prior FL- related visual analytics (VA) frameworks are developed based on the standard FL scenario of single global model and are hence inapplicable to the CFL case of multiple global (cluster) models. To fill the research gap, this study proposes a novel VA framework named cCFLvis to illustrate and analyse variation of fairness during the CFL learning process. A new metric, change of absolute deviation from the mean (ΔAD), is introduced to quantify such variation. Client embeddings are generated by contrastive learning-based dimensionality reduction techniques to facilitate 2-d visualisation of client disparity. Visual cues can be drawn to help understand fairness variation and to offer clues for improving learning outcomes. cCFL vis is a general framework applicable to various CFL methods.

We argue that this approach is more suitable for guided VA systems such as ours, where user strategies, goals and even trust can evolve over time, in reaction to new system feedback and insights from the exploration. Through the analysis of log data from a past user study with twelve participants performing a guided visual analysis task, we found that the stability of user exploration strategies is a promising factor to study trust. However, indirect metrics based on provenance, such as user evaluation counts and disagreement rates, are alone not sufficient to study trust reliably in guided VA.
